Ms. Rosenberg is a former editorial writer for The New York Times.
A month ago on a college campus in Newburgh, N.Y., an unusual group gathered to talk about gun violence: community leaders, social service providers, the police chief, the district attorney, a staff member of the United States attorneys office  and 11 of the most dangerous individuals in Newburgh.
A few years ago, this town of 30,000 had the highest rates of violent crime and homicide in New York State. The gathering  the seventh since October 2015  was part of the citys response: its Group Violence Intervention.
The 10 men and one woman had been required to attend by their probation or parole officers. They were nervous. A few had brought along a mother, aunt or uncle. The police chose them because they were members of the gangs or crews most likely to shoot someone, or be shot  usually active gangs in active disputes.
Each individual had received a personalized letter signed by the police chief and district attorney, warning of this peril. We want you safe, alive and out of prison, the letter said. It then laid out the long prison terms they faced if caught with a gun or committing a gun crime.
At the meeting, Police Lt. Joseph Cortez showed slides with photos of men arrested recently in Newburgh, along with the sentences they were serving. They didnt take the opportunity to get out of the lifestyle, he said, urging the people in the room to choose differently. Now you and your group are going to be getting a lot of scrutiny.
You can see them really lean forward at that point, said Isabel Rojas, a former New York City police officer who runs the intervention out of the district attorneys office.
Then Ms. Rojas introduced staff members from the organization Exodus Transitional Community and urged people to call for help with resumes, job training, graduation equivalency diploma preparation, housing  whatever they needed.
A pastor, a mother who had lost her son and a formerly incarcerated man spoke about the impact of guns. Some guys just sit there and look like theyre bored to death, Ms. Rojas said. But most, you can tell its getting to them. They drop their heads down. Thats the voice of pain, and theyre thinking, I wouldnt want my mom to go through this. 
And then food: wrap sandwiches, salad and brownies. Something nice, Ms. Rojas said. We have it catered. Not pizza.
The March for Our Lives, with its diverse speakers, remembered something that is often overlooked in the national debate over guns: killings by school shooters and terrorists make up less than 3 percent of the nations gun homicides.
Many people can envision getting in the path of a mass shooter. But few with any influence imagine themselves threatened by everyday urban violence. As has always been true in criminal justice (see most recently: Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La.), the United States values a black life far less than a white one.
Florida, for example, just passed a $400 million bill to arm school employees and fund school safety programs, in addition to adopting some small gun-control measures. It contains no money for urban gun violence.
Yet a child is statistically safer in school than anywhere else. A school can expect a shooting once every few thousand years. If police officers are moved to schools from other places, safety overall will decrease. (It can also lead to stoking the school-to-prison pipeline through more arrests of children  usually African-American boys  for ordinary acting out.)
We do not know how to stop mass shootings. But we do know how to reduce urban gun violence. Strong evidence exists for several programs. Perhaps the best-proven is what Newburgh does, a strategy called focused deterrence.
A new paper surveyed 24 studies of focused deterrence initiatives and found noteworthy crime control and solid support for the adoption of such programs by police agencies. Other studies  reports are available here, here and here  have found the same.
Focused deterrence is the opposite of zero tolerance policing, which seeks to punish disorder and minor crimes, often with mass arrests, on the theory that disorder sends a message that crime is tolerated.
Instead, focused deterrence targets the very worst behavior of the most violent. It doesnt seek to dismantle gangs  just to keep them from shooting. No mass arrests are necessary to send a message that the community condemns violence. Mothers, pastors and youth leaders tell criminals so, directly.
More than 80 cities are using the strategy, which often goes by the name Ceasefire. Many more would use it if they had help and funding. Its a lot cheaper than hiring more police, but it does require some money, especially to set up. After that, many cities run it with no additional resources.
Newburgh could do it because New York State has its Gun-Involved Violence Elimination Initiative, which gives cities with high rates of violent crime money and technical support to use evidence-based programs.
But New York is virtually alone, one of only a few states that do this. At the federal level, there have been very few grants for urban gun crime prevention. The administrations budget for 2019, however, calls for a major increase in money cities might use to fund focused deterrence programs.
The father of focused deterrence is David Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City and the leader of the National Network for Safe Communities, which spreads focused deterrence, among other strategies. In 1994, Mr. Kennedy and other academics went to the Boston Police Department and asked to start a working group to combat youth homicide. Two years later, Operation Ceasefire made its debut there and produced an immediate and sustained drop in youth homicide and shootings, unlike that of any other American city.
Ceasefire recognized that homicide and gun violence overwhelmingly are driven by a very small network of very high-risk people, Mr. Kennedy said. Its not about dangerous neighborhoods full of bad people. The community wants to be safe and hates violence.
Antonio Cediel, an educator and community organizer, runs urban anti-violence programs at the PICO Network, a national organization of faith-based groups. PICO is helping a dozen cities start Ceasefire-type programs. Mr. Cediel said that in his home city of Oakland, Calif., with 420,000 people, between 250 and 350 people are responsible for a majority of the shootings. And at any moment only about 50 to 100 are responsible  depending on which disputes and grievances are running hot.
Late in March, two gangs in Newburgh had a run-in, during which shots were fired and a man in a car ran over two people. (Nobody died.) There was going to be some major retaliation, Lt. Cortez said. He and Ms. Rojas spent Monday visiting the homes of individuals likely to be involved.
In what is called a custom notification, they knocked on the door and asked to see the individual. If someone doesnt want to talk to us, we talk to a sister or brother or mother, Ms. Rojas said. The message is the same as in the call-in: If you retaliate, a long prison sentence awaits. We want you alive, safe and free. Heres the number to call, 24/7, to get any kind of help you need.
We visited nine guys, and eight ended up calling for help, Ms. Rojas said. Some people say, Dont knock on my door again. But 90 percent of the time, people are welcoming. Its heartbreaking to hear from family, I dont know what else to do. This is a blessing. 
In Pittsburgh homicides hit a 12-year low in 2017; the mayor credited Ceasefire.
Detroits homicide rate hit a 50-year low in 2017. Its police chief, James Craig, said in an interview that the city had started Ceasefire in two high-crime precincts in 2015 and has gradually expanded it. I wasnt much of a believer when I first got to Detroit, he said. But what we have in place now is probably one of the better-working Ceasefire models. It has had a profound impact on sustaining violent crime reduction.
In Newburgh, statistics in a voluminous New York State report show shootings are way down (See pdf, page 1202)  from 55 victims in 2015 to 17 last year. Violent crime, especially firearm crime, has plummeted.
In 2012, the year Oakland began its current version of Ceasefire, it was the third-most dangerous American city, with 126 murders. Last year it had 74. In 2017, Oakland had  277 nonfatal shootings  down from 557 in 2012.
Many cities are on their second or third try at Ceasefire. In Boston, it perished of its own success: After its leaders became celebrities and left the city, the homicide rate went back up.
In the past, Oakland, Newburgh and Pittsburgh had all used Ceasefire, but abandoned it when it didnt lower violent crime.
Why didnt it work then? For Ceasefire to be effective, a city needs to do a lot of things well. But cities sometimes concentrate only on law enforcement  the easiest part, because its business as usual.
David Muhammad, a community organizer who worked on Ceasefire in Oakland  he now trains people in the practice with the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform  said that Oaklands earlier attempts were disorganized, unfocused and too reliant on law enforcement. He and others said that its succeeding now because the city uses better data, a full-time administrator and top-level social services.
Reygan Cunningham, who runs the new Ceasefire Oakland, points out that the services predated Ceasefire and are open to everyone. The difference is that theyre now tailored to people at the very highest risk of violence, she said.
Perhaps most important, though, is the involvement of local people from high-crime neighborhoods. Mr. Cediel credits the community groups with bringing Ceasefire back to Oakland. They filled up one of the biggest churches in the city and had the mayor and police chief and D.A. at the front with cameras and made them commit to doing it, publicly, he said.
Mr. Muhammad said that Oakland focuses on the message that the community condemns violence. The police play only a minor role in call-ins. Community members handle the custom notifications.
The moral voice of the community is way more powerful than the police, Mr. Kennedy said. When he trains police officers, he often asks if they were afraid of the police when they were growing up. A few people raise their hands. Then we ask: Who was afraid of your mother? Everybody raises his hand.

By MANOHLA DARGISMARCH 8, 2018

The comedy of cruelty is rarely funnier or more brutal than when it comes from Armando Iannucci, a virtuoso of political evisceration. A comic talent who should be household famous, he is best known for Veep, the HBO series about Washington politics that was a satire when it first hit in 2012 but now seems like a reality show. He also directed the movie In the Loop, an aptly obscene burlesque about the run-up to the Iraq War. He only seems to have abandoned contemporary politics in his latest, The Death of Stalin, an eccentric comic shocker about a strong man and his world of ashes and blood.
The laughs come in jolts and waves in The Death of Stalin, delivered in a brilliantly arranged mix of savage one-liners, lacerating dialogue and perfectly timed slapstick that wouldnt be out of place in a Three Stooges bit. Turning horror into comedy is nothing new, but Mr. Iannuccis unwavering embrace of these seemingly discordant genres as twin principles is bracing. In The Death of Stalin, fear is so overwhelming, so deeply embedded in everyday life that it distorts ordinary expression, utterances, gestures and bodies. It has turned faces into masks (alternately tragic and comic), people into caricatures, death into a punch line.
The movie opens in early March 1953. The iron-fisted Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin), 74, has ruled the Soviet Union for decades and racked up countless crimes against humanity and millions of victims. A near-monosyllabic thug with a helmet of steel-gray hair and a retinue of flatterers  Khrushchev and Molotov are among the names crowding this familiar roll call  Stalin likes classical music and old westerns, a casual reminder that barbarism and civilization are often partners in crime. Squirreled away in a dacha, a relatively modest woodland retreat at a remove from the Kremlin, Stalin kicks back with his toadies only to fall grievously ill later that same evening.
A preview of the film.
He briefly hangs on, gasping but mute, throwing his nominal comrades in arms into a fast-spiraling panic. The most appealing, or rather the least obviously terrible, of these is Khrushchev (a superb Steve Buscemi), the minister of agriculture and a cunning, outwardly drab schemer. Like a seasoned standup, Khrushchev tells his wife which of his jokes made Stalin laugh, an accounting that she dutifully preserves for future reference. When he learns that Stalin has taken ill, Khrushchev hastily pulls a jacket and pants over his pajamas and rushes to his side, where Beria (Simon Russell Beale, brilliant), the head of the secret police, the N.K.V.D., has already taken up position and begun plotting.
Advertisement
The Death of Stalin is based on graphic novels by Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin, and Mr. Nury shares writing credit here with Mr. Iannucci, David Schneider, Ian Martin and Peter Fellows. Its a seamless effort that comes alive with a dazzling ensemble that includes Jason Isaacs as Zhukov, a preening military force, and Michael Palin as Molotov, a first deputy prime minister. When the story opens, Molotov has no inkling that hes about to make a miraculous escape. Like the rest of Stalins men, he has helped create a world of bureaucratically administered terror, one in which each bullet to the head is rationalized on a neatly typed hit list. And now hes on such a list.
Advertisement
Mr. Iannucci draws from history with its competing narratives, bending it to his purposes. Real traumas and outrages are mentioned in passing, rather than dutifully explained; theres a brief look inside the gulag, for instance, with its desperate prisoners and splatters of blood. For the most part, though, the Stalin-era atrocities are the ghastly background for the frantic intrigue of his hangers on. Khrushchev soon emerges as one of the canniest of these survivors, though Beria moves faster and initially with far more lethal force. Soon after Stalin finally dies, Beria sends out his own kill list, embracing  as Selina Meyer of Veep once put it  continuity with change.
The action shifts to Moscow and assorted gruesome and grandiose interiors in which Khrushchev and the rest take turns organizing the funeral and their own uncertain futures. Karl Marx increasingly gives way to the Marx Brothers as Stalins son and daughter (the contrapuntal Rupert Friend and Andrea Riseborough) rush in to wail and thunder, adding absurdity and self-dramatizing melodrama to the mix. There are secret meetings, crowds of mourners, visiting dignitaries and more secret meetings. Mr. Iannucci is particularly good at the theater of sycophancy and at all the ways in which supplicating faces, hands and bodies can quiver in fear and with a terrible love.
The Death of Stalin is by turns entertaining and unsettling, with laughs that morph into gasps and uneasy gasps that erupt into queasy, choking laughs. Mr. Iannuccis decision to have the performers speak in an array of accented English  from Brooklyn to Cockney  carries some political resonance, suggesting that totalitarianism knows no borders. But it also makes the familiar strange, creating a Brechtian alienation that few movies succeed in pulling off. Mr. Buscemi plays Khrushchev with persuasive realism, and he certainly looks the part, with his bald head and boxy clothing. But the characters Brooklyn accent also underscores Mr. Buscemis identity, making him present, too.
This doubling in which both the actor and the character wave at the audience is also a familiar comic strategy, one used by the likes of Bugs Bunny and Jim Carrey. It fits for a movie in which almost all the characters have been playing variations on the same role of slavishly adoring, lethally submissive servant. Stalin hasnt taken his final breath before Beria and Khrushchev stop playing those roles; others, like Molotov and Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor), the deputy prime minister and Stalins heir apparent, scarcely seem to have anything left except their long-enacted performances.
In his book The Last Days of Stalin, Joshua Rubenstein captures the dictators power over the Soviet Union in a quote: Stalin was inside everyone, like the hammer alongside the sickle in every mind. In Mr. Iannuccis movie, you see the hammer and the sickle in each pale, scheming face, in every prison cell and bootlickers smile. Its in Berias every move and there when Malenkov puts on a dolorous face and a corset, setting the timer for his own end. There are times when Mr. Iannucci seems as merciless as he is funny; hope can seem very distant here. Yet he also suggests  with the help of a pianist played by Olga Kurylenko and the example of his movie  that art is one sure path to resistance.

NEW YORK   A survivor of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting joined the Rev. Al Sharpton on Saturday to announce a June rally in front of President Donald Trump's Manhattan apartment to protest gun violence eased by access to assault weapons.
Aalayah Eastmond, a junior at Stoneman Douglas High School, was at Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem for the minister's weekly meetings.
Sixteen-year-old Eastmond was in class Feb. 14 when a gunman fired through a window, sparing her but eventually killing 17 people.
The June 2 rally  at the beginning of New York state's Gun Violence Awareness Month  is to start at Trump International Tower on Columbus Circle and proceed toward Fifth Avenue and Trump Tower, where Trump has an apartment that has been his longtime home.

For Eastmond, New York City is more than a prominent media staging ground. One of her family members was fatally shot here.

Sharpton said that young people leading recent activism across the country has produced what he called "a necessary marriage of dealing with gun violence as an American issue that jumps over the boundaries of any community and deals with America from every city."
Another Sharpton concern is how police handle interactions with the mentally ill. On Thursday, police fatally shot a Brooklyn man, Saheed Vassell, as he brandished what turned out to be a welding torch mistaken for a gun.
Among the June rally organizers is Ramon Contreras, 19, a senior at one of 11 NYC College Prep charter schools who lost a classmate to gun violence last October.
"He was only 17 years old," Contreras said. "The way it affected me, I was lost."
He said everybody wanted to do something, but felt "we didn't have the resources."
Last month, "the nationwide walkout gave us the courage, and pretty much the strength to say, 'Hey, enough is enough.'"

MONTPELIER, Vt.   Two separate bills design to further help prevent gun violence in Vermont were unanimously approved by the Vermont Legislature on Thursday and Gov. Phil Scott said he will sign them along with another more controversial piece of legislation.
On Thursday, the Senate voted 30-0 for a law designed to make it easier for police to take firearms from people in dangerous situations, such as when a person is deemed suicidal. The House voted 133-0 in favor of a separate bill that makes it easier for police to remove firearms from people suspected in cases of domestic violence.
Neither piece of legislation drew the ire of gun rights supporters in the way as the legislation passed last week that would raise the legal age for gun purchases, expand background checks for private gun sales and ban high-capacity magazines and rapid-fire devices known as bump stocks.
Scott, speaking Thursday at a Statehouse news conference, said he planned to sign the three bills into law in a single ceremony. Timing is uncertain. But he said more needed to be done to prevent gun violence.

"This is an issue that we are all facing and it's going to take a lot of additional steps," said Scott.
Advertisement
An assessment he ordered on school safety has been completed and he is expecting recommendations soon.
Vermont traditionally has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country. But Scott, a gun-owner and long-time opponent of guns restrictions, changed his mind after a Poultney teenager was arrested on charges he planned to kill as many people as possible at a high school he once attended. The teen's arrest came a day after the Parkland, Florida, shooting that killed 17.

Scott then urged the Legislature to pass gun restrictions as part of a broader package of ideas to reduce school violence.
The two pieces of legislation that were given final approval Thursday even won the support of many gun-rights advocates.
But the bill that would raise the age to buy firearms and impose other restrictions is fiercely opposed by gun rights groups. Many gun supporters have become a presence at the Statehouse.
On Thursday, Bert Saldi, of Barre, a regular gun supporter at the Statehouse, said he didn't think the bill passed last week would do anything to reduce violence.
"It's crazy because none of it is going to work," Saldi said.

JANESVILLE, Wis.   Some Wisconsin students who took their demonstration against gun violence on the road reached their destination Wednesday  House Speaker Paul Ryan's home turf.
About 50 students set out Sunday from Madison on their "50 Miles More" march. They reached their destination in Janesville and demonstrated in a park for stricter gun laws. Ryan, a Republican who has opposed gun restrictions, is in the Czech Republic on an official visit and was not there when the marchers arrived.
The march came more than a month after a gunman killed 17 students and staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
Bea Windorski said she marched because gun violence "affects every single American, especially the students of America. Enough is enough."

The students carried signs reading "No more silence! End gun violence" and "Books not bullets," and they chanted "Hey hey, ho ho, the NRA has got to go."

One supporter took the podium during the demonstration and broke down in tears.
"I am standing here so my voice is heard. We are all standing here so our voices will be heard. And if Paul Ryan and other politicians refuse, then we will take our voices to the voting booth in November," said Maria Mendoza, a march supporter.

Katie Eder, one of the march organizers, said she kept moving "because despite so many people telling us that ending gun violence is impossible, it's too ambitious, it's too difficult, I believe with every bone in my very sore body that this is the time to do the impossible."
Not all the speakers were students. Pardeep Kaleka, whose father and five others were fatally shot at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in August 2012, also spoke. He said the students were an answer to his father's prayers that he said as he was dying.
The students said they want a ban on military-style guns and accessories that turn semi-automatic weapons into automatic weapons. They also want a four-day waiting period for all gun purchases, background checks on all gun sales, and the legal age to buy a gun increased to 21.
Adult volunteers walked with the students, who spent the nights in schools along the route.

Guns in the home protect families.
For decades, that has been an essential part of the National Rifle Associations mantra in defending firearms ownership, repeated at congressional hearings, in advertisements and on T-shirts.
Dr. Mark Rosenberg, who once headed research on firearm violence at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wondered if there was any evidence backing the N.R.A.s assertion.
So we looked at the question, does having a gun at home protect your family or not? Dr. Rosenberg recalled.
He was amazed by the answer. The landmark study in 1993 showed that bringing a gun into the home puts everyone at much greater risk.

They were saying if you want to keep your family safe, if you are a real man, you will have a gun at home, Dr. Rosenberg said. Bringing the gun not only didnt protect you, it put you at much, much greater risk.

To this day, gun rights advocates dispute the studys findings. The N.R.A. pushed Congress in 1995 to stop the C.D.C. from spending taxpayer money on research that advocated gun control. Congress then passed the Dickey Amendment in 1996, and cut funding that effectively ended the C.D.C.s study of gun violence as a public health issue.
The result is that 22 years and more than 600,000 gunshot victims later, much of the federal government has largely abandoned efforts to learn why people shoot one another, or themselves, and what can be done to prevent gun violence.
After the Parkland school massacre in Florida last month, lawmakers and gun control experts have demanded that the agency take up the issue of studying gun violence again, arguing that the federal law doesnt ban such research altogether but prohibits advocacy of gun control.
Alex M. Azar II, the secretary for health and human services, said at a congressional hearing that he believed the C.D.C. should resume the work. Were in the science business and the evidence-generating business, Mr. Azar said, and so I will have our agency certainly working in this field, as they do across the broad spectrum of disease control and prevention.
At a meeting with reporters last week, Mr. Azar said that other priorities, like fighting the flu and Ebola, also competed for funds. He did not specify which subjects would be a priority, how much money he might ask Congress to allocate to gun violence research, or whether he will transfer money from other health agency programs.
There is no shortage of ideas  or criticism of the time lost in studying gun violence.
We have repeatedly and consciously turned our back on the problem, said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine who in July started the Firearm Violence Research Center at the University of California, Davis, with funding from the state. How many thousands of people are dead today who might have been alive if that research effort had been put in place and we had answered critical questions and set prevention measures in motion?
Its a question that haunts researchers. In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, President Obama directed the C.D.C. to reconsider gun violence research. The agency commissioned a report from the Institute of Medicine outlining priorities, but never followed up.

The most pressing questions cited by the institute, now known as the National Academy of Medicine, still have no answers. Who is most likely to use a gun in a crime, and where does the gun come from? How often are guns used in domestic violence cases? How often are the people who are arrested for gun crimes the same individuals who actually bought the weapons?
Then there is a separate set of questions about what kind of policy changes or prevention efforts actually reduce gun-related deaths and injuries.
Andrew R. Morral, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, directed a recent study  that found moderate evidence that background checks do reduce both firearm suicides and homicides. The report also said there is moderate evidence that stand-your-ground laws, which allow people to use guns to defend themselves without first trying to retreat, may increase the murder rate.
In many cases, weve been having arguments about factual matters for decades, Mr. Morral said. As an example, he cited laws that seek to prevent children from killing themselves or others with guns.
The N.R.A. has argued that such laws make it tough for people to defend themselves in a crisis, Mr. Morral said. But theres no research on that. Weve argued and argued and argued, and we have not invested in the research needed to answer the question: What is the trade-off between childhood deaths and self-defense?
The new set of proposals by President Trump calls for a commission to examine whether to raise the age to 21 from 18 for young people to buy certain firearms. Just after the Parkland killings, Mr. Trump repeatedly supported raising the age, but the latest proposals do not include such a measure  one that the N.R.A. opposes.
Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who was director of the C.D.C. from 2009 to 2017, said in an email that he believed the study of firearms-related violence was important even though little was conducted during his tenure.
Thats why year after year I asked Congress to fund C.D.C. to do research in this area, Dr. Frieden said. We need to know which interventions are most effective and how they can best be implemented to save the most lives.

But Congress refused to include funding for those proposals, he said. The National Institutes of Health has continued to fund some gun violence research, including violent crimes related to drug and alcohol consumption, and parental roles in preventing injury from firearms.

N.I.H. is also assessing ways to reduce suicides and accidental deaths among children and adolescents and war veterans. More than 60 percent of all gun deaths in the United States are suicides.
The Justice Department also studies gun violence, but the budget for that research is a small fraction of what the federal government spends on looking at other high-mortality hazards, like car accidents or smoking  money that has led to actions that greatly reduced deaths in both categories.
Private foundations have stepped up to fill the gap. But there is another congressional roadblock that private money cannot circumvent  the Tiahrt Amendments, which prevent the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from sharing its firearms-tracking database with anyone outside of law enforcement.
Those records, Mr. Morral and other experts say, are crucial to analyze the flow of guns used in crimes over state borders, from places where guns are easy to buy to places where it is tougher.
The Dickey Amendment technically did not ban gun research, only advocacy. Its real goal  one it easily achieved, according to public health officials in place at the time  was to scare federal agencies into thinking twice about even collecting data that might reflect badly on gun ownership.
Since the Parkland murders, there have been signs of change. Several Republican lawmakers said they would support the C.D.C. taking on the issue.
Theres a tremendous misunderstanding here and maybe an overabundance of caution on the part of C.D.C. and N.I.H., said Representative Tom Cole, of Oklahoma, chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for the health and human services department.
In an interview, Mr. Cole also said he expected there would be money available for such work at both N.I.H. and C.D.C., but not until next years appropriations.

Some Democrats are pressing to take advantage of the new mood on Capitol Hill. Senator Patty Murray, of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the health committee, and Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, have both pressed Mr. Azar for details, but as of Friday neither had received a response.
From fighting cancer to decreasing road traffic fatalities, public health research has played a critical role in saving lives, Ms. Murray wrote to Mr. Azar. It is immoral and unacceptable to treat gun violence any differently.
In the House of Representatives, Democratic members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce have called for a hearing on the adequacy of federal research into gun violence.
Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A., said the group continues to support the Dickey Amendment. We oppose taxpayer dollars being spent to advocate for gun control, Ms. Baker said.
Asked if there is any type of research the group would support, she said the N.R.A. would like to see a study of how often firearms are used in self-defense.
The Institute of Medicine report, published with the National Research Council, is still considered a road map by the C.D.C. The report proposed research on issues like motivations for gun ownership and use; the relationship between poverty and gun use; risk factors that lead youths to carry guns; and dozens of other questions.
The C.D.C. did ask for and receive money to expand its National Violent Death Reporting System, which tracks homicides and suicides in 40 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The project aims to help state health departments develop strategies to reduce violent deaths, but some critics say the database lacks sufficient detail to be very useful.
Research proponents want to make sure that new studies dont serve as an excuse for a lack of action on gun control.
Although more gun research is needed, Dr. Frieden said, there are proven means to reduce gun violence, including better background checks, getting guns away from domestic abusers and people convicted of violent crimes, and safe storage. More research can help. But this is no excuse for inaction.

From the moment Woody Harrelson swaggers into LBJ, you can see the glinting intelligence and hear the thudding heartbeat that he brings to the title character. It couldnt have been easy. Hes nearly entombed in facial makeup that obscures his own physiognomy  an actors landscape  while bringing to life Lyndon B. Johnson, a transitional, still-contentious figure of fascinating contradictions. This was, history tells us, a politician who early in his career spoke against civil rights legislation yet signed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, a president who declared an unconditional war on poverty at home even as he escalated the war in Vietnam.
A preview of the film.
Only some of that history makes it into this disappointing movie, which tracks Johnsons road from the Senate to the vice presidency and then the presidency, an ascension that culminates with him assuming the role of the nations healer after John F. Kennedys death. Its a near-miraculous, compressed coming into consciousness (the movie runs 98 minutes) that develops through different time frames and neatly dovetailing scenes that suggest history is plotted by that great filmmaker in the sky. One moment its 1960 and Johnson is weighing his chances as the next Democratic presidential nominee; the next, he is struggling to find a place in the Kennedy administration and vainly looking for political love in the Oval Office.
Mr. Harrelson makes Johnson an almost predictably entertaining force, and his performance fills the movie with oxygen whether hes barnstorming through politics, slamming down phones, lobbing obscenities, braying at his staff from a toilet seat or gleefully grabbing his crotch while announcing that his tailor needs to make his pants roomier. Hes fun to watch despite the facial makeup, which is so distractingly exaggerated that when I wasnt thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire I was flashing on the rubbery presidential masks worn by the bank robbers in Point Break. Its a wonder that Mr. Harrelson can convey any emotion through all that latexy blubber much less keep drawing you closer to him. I recognized the similarly encumbered Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays Lady Bird, only when she started talking.
Directed by Rob Reiner from Joey Hartstones script, LBJ is a frustratingly underdeveloped vehicle for Mr. Harrelsons talents as well as an unfortunate missed opportunity. Mr. Harrelson hits his beats with charismatic menace and a reverberant Texas twang, but hes booming in a vacuum. Part of the problem is the filmmakers never figure out why this particular story needed to be told at this specific moment; it feels at once dutiful and arbitrary. Thats too bad, especially given that it could have continued a story told through Obama-era movies  Selma, Jackie, Marshall  that, both directly and obliquely, speak to the present through the convulsions of the 1960s.
Taken together, these movies create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a profoundly changing nation using black, female and marginal characters who once would have remained behind while the white hero went off to write history. They represent, onscreen and off, the very changes that they narrate. With its armies of pale men and next to no black characters, LBJ doesnt look all that different from most other great-man stories. Yet there are moments  Johnson conspiring with a racist power broker played by an excellent Richard Jenkins  when the filmmakers seem ready to shake up the story by laying white, male power bare in all its ugliness. In scenes like these, the movie inches around complexity even as it continues to clear the way for another make-believe savior.

WASHINGTON  Sprinkled amid the throngs of young people protesting gun violence in Washington on Saturday were groups of students without signs denouncing President Trump, or the National Rifle Association, or the shooting massacres that have plagued the nation.
Instead, they carried megaphones and wore T-shirts calling attention to something close and constant: urban gun violence.
In cities such as Baltimore, the anguish of shootings feels different  the bloodshed comes not in isolated bursts of mass slaughter, but instead in a ceaseless rhythm, something that happens to friends and family, classmates and neighbors, in front yards and on playgrounds.
In the inner city, theres a game: gunshots or firecrackers? said Steve Sias, a high school student at Baltimore City College who came to the Washington march. Whenever you hear the sound, you ask everyone in the house: Is it gunshots or firecrackers? Usually the parents say firecrackers so they dont startle the kids. But more times than not its actually gunshots in the distance, or right outside your window.

Last year, Baltimore set a per capita record for homicides: 343 total, or about 56 for every 100,000 people. The citys population is just over 600,000. Its murder rate was by far the highest among the nations 30 largest cities.

Students from Baltimore, as well as young people who attended a rally in Chicago, were vocal on Saturday about the need for steps to reduce gun violence, much in the same way as students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people last month. But they had a different idea of the problem.
Destini Philpot, another student at Baltimore City College, was joined on Saturday in Washington by Carrie Zaremba, a student at the Friends School of Baltimore, a predominantly white Quaker institution. The two said they had helped organize a citywide walkout this month that involved both public and private schools.
It shouldnt take a mass shooting in a predominantly white area like Parkland to start caring about gun violence, Ms. Zaremba said.
Ms. Philpot said that many of those at the rally were thinking of gun violence in the only way they knew how: as mass shootings.
KeShon Newmans brother was shot nine times on Chicagos South Side, where gun violence is a daily threat. Now, KeShon is heading to Washington to march with high school students from Parkland, Fla.
When they talk about gun violence, theyre talking about schools, she said.
Private donors paid for 60 buses that carried around 3,000 Baltimore students to the Washington event. Some Baltimore organizers skipped their citys satellite march to attend the one in the capital, hoping to reach an audience largely unfamiliar with the kind of violence that visits them with gruesome regularity.
One of those organizers, Erricka Bridgeford, has helped work on a campaign called Baltimore Ceasefire, which holds quarterly cease-fire weekends that call for a stop to killings for a three-day period.
On Saturday, she recalled what had brought her to Washington: the lasting agony from losing her brother, stepson and friends to gun violence.

Ive seen dead bodies and blood, she said. These are things you never recover from. You learn how to live your life differently, because the air looks different once you experience that kind of trauma. I have to do something with the pain. I dont want to be a prisoner to it.
Ms. Bridgeford said shootings were a never-ending feature of life in her Baltimore neighborhood.
Theres no such thing as post-traumatic stress in a lot of communities in America, because theres no post, she said. You dont get a chance to experience the aftermath before theres another trauma because of gun violence.
One of the students walking with Ms. Bridgeford was Shanika Walker, who attends the Excel Academy at Francis M. Wood High School in Baltimore, which recently lost seven students to homicide in 15 months.

Only the scared people have guns, and they kill people theyre scared of, she said. Theres a lot of fear.
On Chicagos Near West Side on Saturday, just a few miles from neighborhoods where shootings are common, thousands filled Union Park to protest a problem just as local.
Many came to the rally bearing personal stories of tragedy and loss, years of frustration with unchanged gun laws and hope replenished by recent student-led activism.

                Crowds gathered in cities across the United States and around the world.            
We have been fighting for a long, long time, said Maria Pike, whose son, Ricky, 24, was shot to death in 2012. And their voice is a fresh voice, is a true voice, is a transparent voice. And it comes from the heart.
Speaker after speaker at the Chicago rally mentioned relatives or classmates who had been wounded or killed in shootings, frustrated that past calls to action had not led to change.
Chicago has been plagued with gun violence way before the Parkland shooting, said Juan Reyes, a high school student. Suddenly, people are talking about students not feeling safe in schools. But in reality, students in our citys South and West Sides have never felt safe.

One high school student, Denzel Russell, told the crowd, I have watched one of my friends get murdered while we were playing on the basketball court. That experience had me frozen and speechless.
Mr. Russell added: We can come together for a march. But are we willing to come together to take action?
Emerson Toomey, 17, who helped organize the Chicago march, said her mother was grazed by a bullet in a drive-by shooting on the North Side of the city.
Its more about the journey to school for some kids than it is about the actual day at school, she said.
But for the teachers who believe they must now think as much about school shootings as they do about urban gun violence, Saturdays rallies in Washington and Chicago felt like the meeting of two threats, now inseparable.
I see the look on the students faces, said Jeremy McConnell, a special education teacher at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Baltimore. They come from these communities. They come from these families that engage in this kind of violence. They might be a sibling or neighbor removed.
They know gun violence is real. They see it in the streets, added Mr. McConnell, who, as the voice behind public address announcements at the school, reminds students to be vigilant after news of shootings in Baltimore and across the country. But they havent seen it in school. They think any day now its coming here.
Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Chicago.

Student Opinion 
By                     
 CAROLINE CROSSON GILPIN
 
MARCH 28, 2018

The Second Amendment to the Constitution reads:
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
The Library of Congress writes, The meaning of this sentence is not self-evident, and has given rise to much commentary but relatively few Supreme Court decisions.
What do you think the words of the Second Amendment mean? What relevance should they have for the national debate about gun laws?
Then read these four excerpts from Opinion pieces published this month in The Times  or follow the links to read the complete Op-Ed  and decide: What do you think lawmakers should do about guns and gun violence?
Excerpt 1: In John Paul Stevens: Repeal the Second Amendment, John Paul Stevens, a retired associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, writes:
Rarely in my lifetime have I seen the type of civic engagement schoolchildren and their supporters demonstrated in Washington and other major cities throughout the country this past Saturday. These demonstrations demand our respect. They reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society.
That support is a clear sign to lawmakers to enact legislation prohibiting civilian ownership of semiautomatic weapons, increasing the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 years old, and establishing more comprehensive background checks on all purchasers of firearms. But the demonstrators should seek more effective and more lasting reform. They should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment.
_________
Excerpt 2: In After the March, Follow This Gun Reform Battle Plan, Steve Israel, a Democratic representative from Long Island from 2001 to 2017, writes:
It has been 38 days since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.; 174 days since the shooting at a concert in Las Vegas; 1,011 days since the killings at a church in Charleston, S.C.; and 1,926 since the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Ten days ago, students organized a nationwide school walkout to demonstrate their outrage about these and other shootings.
On Saturday they plan to amass in Washington to pressure a Congress that has done nothing meaningful to protect American children in classrooms, movie theaters, churches, malls  because, thanks to the National Rifle Association, many of their elected representatives are too busy protecting their re-election.
My advice to the students? When you finish marching on the mall, march into the specific congressional districts where you can actually make a difference.
He continues:
You can stage marches and school walkouts, but then walk into the swing congressional districts that matter. In the end its not about standing up to be heard. Its about changing who sits in Congress.
_________
Excerpt 3: In Stop Shielding Gun Makers, Brad S. Karp, the chairman of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, and H. Christopher Boehning, a partner there, write:
Senator Charles Schumer has proposed three measures to reduce gun violence: expanded background checks, protective orders to disarm individuals at risk of violence or self-harm, and an assault weapons ban. These proposals are critically important. But there is another effective response that has been largely ignored: repeal of a law that prevents suits against the gun industry.
A bedrock principle of the American legal system is accountability for wrongdoing. Businesses that cause harm may be held legally responsible in a court of law. Through the imposition of financial liability, our legal system encourages businesses to reduce harm to consumers by making their products safer and disclosing the risks associated with their use.
Thanks in part to the accountability imposed by lawsuits, society knows more about the dangers of smoking, and tobacco companies market their products more responsibly. Automakers continually develop and install new safety features, and these innovations deliver results: From 1975 to 2016, the rate of motor vehicle deaths decreased by nearly half. While motor vehicle deaths have declined over the last two decades, firearm deaths have not: According to the most recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people now die from firearms than motor vehicle accidents.
_________
Excerpt 4: In Why Gun Culture Is So Strong in Rural America, Robert Leonard, the news director for the radio stations KNIA and KRLS, writes:
Its been many years since I hunted squirrels and rabbits with my Grandpa Leonard. I grew up around guns and remember the pride I had when I completed my N.R.A.-sponsored gun safety training in Boy Scouts, back when the N.R.A. was a group primarily known for teaching gun appreciation and safety rather than lobbying.
I have come to understand and appreciate arguments for more gun control. But guns are important to the culture in my conservative community in Iowa, and people around here reject most gun control legislation. So I do my best to understand where they are coming from.
One morning after the mass shootings in Parkland, Fla., I spoke about them with a police-officer friend. He has led active-shooter trainings in our schools. He believes that better background checks might help prevent some gun violence, and that people need to do a better job securing their firearms (especially from suicidal teenagers).
But he doesnt believe that significant gun control measures will ever meet approval in rural America, including a ban on AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles. He confided that many conservative police officers do not want more gun control and that other officers have told him that should they ever have to start taking guns away from people, they will quit their jobs. Like most rural conservatives, he truly believes that taking guns away from law-abiding citizens will never solve Americas gun problems, including mass shootings. He says gun control has never stopped criminals from getting guns, and never will.
_________
Students: After reading the four excerpts above, tell us:
 Why does this topic interest you? How have your own experiences shaped your opinions? What questions or concerns does this topic raise for you?
Advertisement
 Do you believe the government is currently striking the right balance between public safety and protecting peoples individual rights? Why or why not?
Advertisement
 Would you rather the government err on the side of protecting an individuals right to own a gun, or on the publics health and safety? Or do you feel this is a false choice? Why?
 After mass shootings or renewed fears that the government will ban gun ownership, many people go out to buy guns  perhaps to feel safer in times of insecurity. Americans now own more than 300 million guns. Do you think people buying more guns will prevent gun deaths?
 How should we try to reduce the number of gun deaths and injuries in the United States? Do you think lawmakers should pursue any of the options discussed in the Opinion pieces above? If so, which ones, and why?
 What other options or possible solutions exist, in your view, and why?
Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.

Demands for gun restrictions have followed one mass shooting after another, but little has changed. This time, the students who survived are leading the charge.
The aftermath of a mass shooting has become a familiar cycle in the United States: One side demands change, the other works to block it.
But this time, it is the students who survived the assault who are pressing lawmakers to impose new restrictions on guns.
On todays episode:
 Michael D. Shear, a White House correspondent for The New York Times.
Background reading:
 The father of a student killed last week at a Florida high school pressed President Trump to act, asking, How many children have to get shot? It was one of many dramatic exchanges on Wednesday about gun violence.

 The students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School lobbied state lawmakers to strengthen gun control, and met resistance.

 Senator Marco Rubio and a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association were repeatedly heckled during a nationally televised forum after they refused to back new gun control measures.

New York Today 
By                     
 ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE
 
MARCH 14, 2018

Good morning on this cloud-shrouded Wednesday.
This morning, instead of attending his usual seminar on United States government, Andrew Myers will address those in power.
Mr. Myers, a senior at the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights, is one of tens of thousands of students nationwide who will walk out of classrooms today to protest gun violence, following the killing of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., a month ago.
Roughly 1,000 Brooklyn students are expected to rally in solidarity today at Borough Hall, according to Mr. Myers, one of the events organizers. Dozens of schools in all five boroughs have registered to take part in walkouts as well.
Most of the students involved are too young to vote. Until he turned 18 in January, Mr. Myers was one of them  an impetus for his civic engagement. This is our only outlet, he said. We cant do anything other than protest.

New York City schools have been relatively safe; the fatal stabbing at a Bronx high school in September was the first killing inside a city school building in more than two decades. Even so, students here inevitably feel the fear and uncertainty that follow school shootings.
Advertisement
Since February, though, a wave of student activism has taken hold, led by the survivors of the Parkland shooting. In rallies, news media appearances and town hall-style events, they have demanded action from elected officials  and that, too, has spread to New York.
Politicians have absolutely failed us, Mr. Myers said, and were marching today to let them know that were here, that we care about this issue, that were the next voting bloc thatll be out there in the midterm elections.
He added, Politicians are bringing up the same talking points they always bring up  mental health, violent video games and student safety  which are all relevant topics, but they all ignore the root of the problem: guns.
The school has been supportive of the student-led effort and faculty members who decide to march, Mr. Myers said.
The Department of Education has also released guidelines for walkouts around the city:
 Middle and high schools will not prevent students from participating.
 Students engaging in peaceful protest will not be arrested, but those putting people or property in danger may be disciplined accordingly.
 Leaving for 17 minutes  to honor the 17 Parkland victims  will be treated as cutting class, not an absence.
At Packer Collegiate Institute, Mr. Myers said, they just want us back in school by 1:15.
Heres what else is happening:
Meh.
Theres a slight chance of flurries this afternoon and evening. Otherwise, its going to be a gray day with temperatures that could feel as nippy as the 20s.

Released without fanfare or publicity screenings, the haunted-house movie Winchester would seem to lack the confidence of its makers. One soon sees why: Despite the typically elevating presence of Helen Mirren, this super-silly feature (the fifth from the Australian brothers Peter and Michael Spierig) stubbornly resists being classed up.
A preview of the film.
Set in 1906 and inspired by actual events (liberally sauced with myth and legend), the story centers on the eccentric Sarah Winchester (Ms. Mirren, grimly determined), heiress to the rifle fortune and eager dabbler in architecture and spiritualism. Believing that she has flourished on the deaths caused by her late husbands invention, Sarah atones by constructing a vast and ever-changing mansion, whose hundreds of rooms are intended to imprison evil spirits or encourage benign ones to move on.
Enter Dr. Price (Jason Clarke), a psychologist hired by the Winchester companys board to count Sarahs marbles and report back. Conveniently addicted to laudanum, Dr. Price is soon staggering around the labyrinthine structure, besieged by generic scares: a creepy butler, a rattling armoire, a child in the grip of milky-eyed possession. The Hogwarts-like domicile might be swarming with staff and construction workers, but not until Price arrives do the spirits hit the fan.
Written by the Spierigs and Tom Vaughan, the script is as batty and clichéd as its heroine. The house (you can take a tour of the real one in San Jose, Calif.) never feels like a single space, as ho-hum apparitions appear and disappear without a trace. Ms. Mirren and her representatives are probably hoping the movie will do likewise.

HONG KONG  A newspaper controlled by the Communist Party of China criticized the United States for its high level of gun violence, calling it hypocritical that a country that condemns others over human rights violations is failing to stem such slaughter at home.
The opinion column in The Global Times, which is run by the Communist Partys Peoples Daily Group, said that after a gunman killed 17 people last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the United States should look to China, which has strict controls on guns.
Its inhumane for the U.S., which boasts about its human rights record, to turn a blind eye to gun violence, snub increasing calls for gun control and risk more innocent lives, the piece said.
The column on guns appeared Friday in the English-language edition of the newspaper, but not in the Chinese print version. While The Global Times is controlled by the Communist Party, it is not an authoritative voice, meaning its pugnacious opinion pieces dont necessarily reflect the views of the Chinese government in the way a commentary in The Peoples Daily would.

Still, the view that guns are a human rights issue in the United States is regularly stated by official sources in China. Chinas annual report on human rights in the United States, which it issues in response to the State Departments reports on Chinas human rights situation, usually mentions gun violence.

In 2016, the U.S. government exercised no effective control over guns, law enforcement departments abused their power, and crimes were not effectively contained, said the most recent report on human rights in the United States from Chinas State Council Information Office. As a result, civil rights, especially the right to life, were seriously threatened and peoples personal rights were continuously infringed upon.
The Global Times regularly covers gun violence in the United States, publishing a commentary after the deadly shootings at a church in Texas in November and a lengthy analysis after the Orlando, Fla., nightclub killings in 2016.

Gun ownership in China is strictly regulated, which helps reduce gun-related crimes and deaths, the latest commentary said. The U.S. should learn from China and genuinely protect human rights.
While China has tight controls on firearms and gun crimes are rare, shootings with illegal firearms do sometimes happen. Knives are the most common weapon used in attacks, leaving unarmed people better able to defend themselves. On Feb. 11 a man with a knife attacked shoppers at a Beijing mall, killing one person and injuring 12 others. Some shoppers and one security guard were seen fending of the assailant with stools and chairs.
Terrorist attacks on civilians have sometimes been carried out in China by groups armed with knives, including an attack on a train station in Kunming that killed 31 people in 2014.
The killings at Stoneman Douglas High School occurred just as China prepared to celebrate the Lunar New Year, and as a result werent widely covered or discussed by the Chinese news media. Some Chinese outlets, including the overseas edition of The Peoples Daily, did make note of the death of Peter Wang, a Chinese-American student who was credited with holding open a door to help students flee as the attacker fired.
Mr. Wang, 15, was born in Brooklyn and spent some of his childhood in China, friends and family told The Miami Herald. He was a Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps cadet who dreamed of one day attending the United States Military Academy at West Point. The academy issued him a ceremonial letter of acceptance, saying his actions showed commitment to duty, honor and country.

A heavily armed young man opened fire on terrified students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday, leaving a death toll of 17.
It is the third mass shooting in the past four months in the United States. 
This pattern has led to a familiar cycle of mourning, introspection and questioning about what can be done to end the violence. Below is a selection of six stories The Times has previously reported around these shootings that give context to this latest tragedy and best inform conversations about the trends in gun violence and potential gun policy considerations. 
When a gunman killed 20 first graders and six adults with an assault rifle at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, it rattled Newtown, Conn., and reverberated across the world. Since then, there have been at least 239 school shootings nationwide. In those episodes, 438 people were shot, 138 of whom were killed.
Read the full story here. 
The military-style weapon has also been the gun of choice in several other mass shootings: at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.; at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.; at a holiday party for county health workers in San Bernardino, Calif.; and at the campus of Umpqua Community College in Oregon.
But the National Rifle Association has taken to calling the AR-15 Americas rifle. Though the federal government does not keep track of exactly how many AR-15s are in circulation, experts estimate that there are easily several million in the nations rifle racks and gun safes  a huge number, given that the gun, along with other so-called assault weapons, was banned under federal law from 1994 to 2004.
Read the full story here. 
A vast majority of guns used in 18 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check. At least nine gunmen had criminal histories or documented mental health problems that did not prevent them from obtaining their weapons.
Read the full story here. 
Fear of gun-buying restrictions has been the main driver of spikes in gun sales, far surpassing the effects of mass shootings and terrorist attacks alone, according to an analysis of federal background check data by The New York Times.
Read the full story here. 
Gun violence researchers say that no law can eliminate the risk of mass shootings, which are unpredictable and represent a small minority of gun homicides over all. But there are a handful of policies that could reduce the likelihood of such events, or reduce the number of people killed when such shootings do occur. And several of them have strong public support.
Read the full story here. 
An ever-growing body of research consistently reaches the same conclusion. The only variable that can explain the high rate of mass shootings in America is its astronomical number of guns.

A heavily armed young man is accused of killing 17 people after opening fire on terrified students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday. It was the third mass shooting in the past four months in the United States. 
Nikolas Cruz, who has been linked to a history of mental illness, is believed to have used a legally obtained AR-15 in the shooting. The attack has led to widespread conversations about links between gun violence and mental illness, and how lawmakers and interest groups are debating potential policy responses. Below is a look at some facts and falsehoods uttered by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin; Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont; and others in the wake of Wednesdays shooting. 
Mr. Ryans claim reflects a common misconception. According to various polls, roughly half of Americans either believe that failing to identify people with mental health problems is the primary cause of gun violence or that addressing mental health issues would be a major deterrent. 
That conclusion is not shared by experts or widely accepted research. 
In an analysis of 235 mass killings, many of which were carried out with firearms, 22 percent of the perpetrators could be considered mentally ill.
Overall, mass shootings by people with serious mental illness represent 1 percent of all gun homicides each year, according to the book Gun Violence and Mental Illness published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2016. 
To be sure, gun violence experts contacted by New York Times reporters have said that barring sales to people who are deemed dangerous by mental health providers could help prevent mass shootings. But the experts said several more measures  including banning assault weapons and barring sales to convicted violent criminals  more effective. 
And, as The Times has reported, Americans do not appear to have more mental health problems than other developed nations of a comparable size, which experience far fewer mass shootings. 
Some further research: 
A 2016 academic study estimated that just 4 percent of violence is associated with serious mental illness alone. Evidence is clear that the large majority of people with mental disorders do not engage in violence against others, and that most violent behavior is due to factors other than mental illness, the study concluded. 
A 2015 study found that less than 5 percent of gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were committed by people diagnosed with mental illness. 
As John T. Monahan, a professor specializing in psychology and law at the University of Virginia, told The Times:
Two things typically happen in the wake of a mass shooting. First, politicians claim that mental illness is the major cause of violence in America. Then, advocates for people with mental illness respond by denying there is any relationship whatsoever between mental illness and violence. Both groups are wrong. Research shows that the association between mental illness and violence is not strong, but it does exist.
The figure is drawn from a list maintained by the advocacy group Every Town for Gun Safety. As the group explains on its site, the total includes any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds.
As The Washington Post, The Washington Examiner and other outlets have pointed out, that includes some incidents that most people would not consider school shootings. For example, the list includes suicides, like a Florida man who shot himself in the parking lot of a school while it was closed. And it also includes accidents like a Minnesota third-grader who pulled the trigger on a police officers holstered weapon, injuring no one. 
Israeli officials and experts rejected this version of events after a similar claim was made by Wayne LaPierre, the president of the National Rifle Association, after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 20 children and six adults were killed. 
Israel had a whole lot of school shootings until they did one thing. They said, Were going to stop it, and they put armed security in every school, and they have not had a problem since then, Mr. LaPierre said in December 2012 on NBC. 
Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told The New York Daily News at the time that the situations in the United States and Israel were fundamentally different and said that the measures that Israel enacted were a response to terrorism.
What removed the danger was not the armed guards, but an overall antiterror policy and antiterror operations, which brought street terrorism down to nearly zero over a number of years, Mr. Palmor said. 
After Mr. Trump focused on mental health in his national address on Thursday in response to the Parkland shooting, many journalists, activists and others, like Mr. Kimmel, noted the repeal of a rule that would have prevented seriously mentally ill people from purchasing guns. 
Federal law already bars anyone who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution from purchasing a gun. And a majority of states have laws requiring them to report mental health information to the national background check system. But gaps in the system still exist. 
After the Newtown shooting, President Obama proposed adding another data source to the background check system: reports from the Social Security Administration of people who receive disability benefits through a third party because of mental impairments. According to a 2016 White House fact sheet, the rule would have affected 75,000 people. 
It was opposed by the National Rifle Association, but also the American Civil Liberties Union, which said the rule violated civil rights. Some disability rights groups also argued against the rule on the basis that it perpetuated stigmas about mental illness. 
Mr. Trump signed a congressional resolution that expressed disapproval of the proposed rule in February 2017, nine months before compliance would have been required.

Letter
To the Editor:
The Pentagons Indifference to Gun Safety (editorial, Nov. 29) makes strong points about the importance of improving the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
But to create real change, we must enact permit-to-buy policies; prohibit those with a history of violent misdemeanors, hate crimes and all domestic violence from getting access to guns; ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; and enact extreme risk protection orders, which allow family members and/or law enforcement to petition a court to temporarily remove guns from those in crisis.
The political climate has shifted. Talking about guns is no longer politically risky. Constituents are demanding change, and as legislation to fix the criminal background check system demonstrates, legislators on both sides of the aisle are stepping up.
Improving the system is only the first step. Legislators must take note of this cultural shift and embrace the numerous evidence-based policies that can keep our country safe.

Article of the Day 
By                     
 CAROLINE CROSSON GILPIN
 
MARCH 14, 2018

Before reading the article: 
Todays article begins:
It started out last month as a writing exercise on the 1963 Birmingham Childrens Crusade, when more than 1,000 students skipped school and marched to demand civil rights. Then the class assignment mushroomed into a plan  hatched by 10- and 11-year-olds  to stage a little civil disobedience of their own.
Watch the five-minute clip below, from the Teaching Tolerance film Mighty Times: The Childrens March, which features recollections of some of the participants of that unified, nonviolent protest in Birmingham, Ala., 55 years ago. What are your reactions to hearing about the 1963 civil rights protest from the student activists, now grown adults?
What other examples can you think of where groups of students or teenagers exercised their First Amendment rights for a cause or to effect change?
Now, read the article, How Young Is Too Young for Protest? A National Gun-Violence Walkout Tests Schools, and answer the following questions: 
1. What is planned for the morning of Wednesday, March 14, in Craig Sampsells fifth-grade class at Case Elementary School in Akron, Ohio?
2. What does the principal, Danjile Henderson, have to say about the student protest at her school, and what lines has she drawn around who can participate and how?
Advertisement
3. What are some of the ways schools and administrators are handling the walkout and why, according to the article?
Advertisement
4. What are some parents hoping for, or concerned about, according to the article?
5. What are some of the details the article gives about walkout plans for other classrooms and districts around the country, and what is their rationale for their decision?
6. What did Maeva Lile say about her friends and classmates and their plans for Wednesdays walkout? Why does she think it is time for children to protest?
Finally, tell us more about what you think:
Will you or your classmates participate in a school walkout to protest gun violence or to honor the students who died in Parkland, Fla.? Do you know what other schools or classes are doing, if anything? Either way, what are your thoughts about what is planned, or not planned, and why?
How young is too young for a protest, in your opinion? Does the type of protest, or the venue, matter? Why or why not?

Sorry dont get it done. With that line, the likable, easygoing western The Ballad of Lefty Brown tips its battered cowboy hat to its genre influences. John Wayne delivers that same admonition in Rio Bravo, Howard Hawkss 1959 masterpiece about a sheriff and a ragtag group holding off a powerful, autocratic rancher. (Waynes sheriff is chiding his alcoholic deputy, played by Dean Martin.) In large and small ways, that film and other classics from the western canon inform Lefty Brown, which opens one dark, stormy night in the Montana territory in 1889, the year it became the 41st state.
A preview of the film.
One of the foundational themes of the western is the making of America, an origin story that plays out in tales about frontiers, borders, wagon trains, settlements, railroads, towns, cowboys and Indians. Invariably, these are narratives of violent transformations in which land becomes property and some people become citizens while others remain outlaws or are turned into permanent exiles. In Lefty Brown, those changes have already affected a Montana rancher, Edward Johnson (Peter Fonda), who has recently been elected a senator and is headed east. Hes a classic type, the outsider as insider who, as he tells his wife, Laura (Kathy Baker), is going to take on all of Washington.
Some 10 minutes into the film, though, a villain fatally derails Edwards plans, spurring the story forward and igniting its slow-burning mystery. Laura accuses Edwards longtime hand, Lefty (Bill Pullman), of failing her husband. (You were supposed to watch his back, a grieving Laura tells an apologetic, equally bereft Lefty. Sorry dont get it done.) Lefty sets off to find Edwards killer, a quest that becomes a journey and leads him straight into trouble. He soon meets an inexpert traveler, Jeremiah (Diego Josef), who has killed his own horse. All Jeremiah knows of the West are the romantic myths that he has learned from tattered dime novels, some of which feature fictionalized tales right out of Leftys past.
The writer-director Jared Moshé takes his time in Lefty Brown, which meanders here and there for close to two hours, ranging over picturesque, Big Sky landscapes while rambling deeper into prickly narrative complications. If there isnt much urgency its partly because Lefty has been rather too closely modeled on the irascible if endearing coots played by the likes of Walter Brennan. Often grizzled comic relief, though sometimes tragic, these sidemen stand in the long, tall shadow of the hero, giving him grief while always following his lead. Theyre loyal dogs, surrogate nannies, maybe close pals. Theyre types that need more to carry a movie than Mr. Moshé has given Lefty.
Like Brennans character, Stumpy, in Rio Bravo, Lefty has a noticeable limp and the pitch of his voice periodically slides to lightly comedic heights. (You can hear a bit of Slim Pickenss warble, too.) At times, Lefty seems like the sum of his inspirations, which remains true even as the film progresses and settles into its groove. Central to the movies modest pleasures is how it engages with screen history; at the same time, as the too familiar story of good men and bad, loyalty and betrayal emerges, these allusions can remind you that youre not watching Howard Hawks. Instead, Jim Caviezel and Tommy Flanagan ride up, and the plot continues to thicken amid firing guns.
Mr. Pullman, his good looks obscured by chiaroscuro shadows and mutton chops, keeps you tethered to Lefty even when the rambling turns to drift. Mr. Moshé knows his genre. Theres beauty in his panoramas and charm in his reflexive gestures, typified by Jeremiahs love for the mythic heroism that foreshadows his and Leftys future. Yet self-consciousness is also a hallmark of this genre; Douglas Fairbankss would-be cowboy reads dime novels in the 1917 film Wild and Woolly. Even so, while Mr. Moshés ambitions can be frustratingly modest, he does know that  however fraudulent the genres myths  the image of a man riding a horse into the sunset is in our cinematic DNA.

Student Opinion

Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control.
Watch the video above. What are your reactions to what these students of Stoneman Douglas High School share?
In A Mass Shooting Generation Cries Out for Change, Audra D. S. Burch, Patricia Mazzei and Jack Healy write:
This is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it.
Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 people this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices  in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman  are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting.
… At other high schools across the country, students rallied in solidarity with Stoneman Douglas High and staged walkouts to protest what they called Washingtons inaction in protecting students and teachers. A gun control advocacy group, Moms Demand Action, said it had been so overwhelmed with requests from students that it was setting up a parallel, student focused advocacy group.
People say its too early to talk about it, Mr. Kasky said. If you ask me, its way too late.
His argument reflects the words of other students who want action: The issue is not an abstraction to them. These are their murdered friends, their bloodstained schools, their upended lives.
Students said they did not want to cede the discussion over their lives to politicians and adult activists.
We need to take it into our hands, Mr. Kasky said.
Students: Read the entire article, then watch the speech from the Stoneman Douglas High School senior Emma González at the Not One More rally for gun legislation held at the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Saturday:
 What role do you think the students of Stoneman Douglas High School and other schools may play in ending gun violence in schools? Why do you think they are having such an impact? Do you think they can do more than adults can right now? Why or why not?
 What do you think about Cameron Kaskys statement that students need to take the discussion into their own hands?
 As children of the mass shooting generation, how might young peoples perspectives be different from older peoples?
Advertisement
 What do you think about the feelings and opinions that Ms. González expresses? What words from her speech do you find especially notable for any reason?
Advertisement
 To what degree do you find her arguments persuasive? Explain.
 How would you respond if you were asked by political leaders and other adults what should be done to end gun violence?
 How do you think people of different generations can learn from each other when it comes to issues like safety in schools?
 What other issues do you feel young people and those in older generations may have different perspectives on? Why?
 Do you think your generation has the power to shape our world here and now? Explain.
Teachers: We also have a related lesson plan that features more on the voices of students: Resources for Talking and Teaching About the School Shooting in Florida

The actor George Clooney and his wife, Amal, a human rights lawyer, said Tuesday that they would donate $500,000 to a nationwide protest against gun violence planned next month by teenage survivors of a Florida high school shooting, inspiring similar gifts from other big-name Hollywood figures.
In a statement, the couple said they were so inspired by the courage and eloquence of these young men and women from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The police say the suspect  a 19-year-old former student, Nikolas Cruz  killed 17 people in a rampage with a semiautomatic weapon there last week.
Our family will be there on March 24 to stand side by side with this incredible generation of young people from all over the country, the Clooneys said. And in the name of our children, Ella and Alexander, were donating 500,000 dollars to help pay for this groundbreaking event.
Our childrens lives depend on it, they added.
The survivors of the Stoneman Douglas school shooting have emerged as influential new voices in the gun debate, urging lawmakers to adopt new gun control measures in protests outside schools and national television appearances that have been shared widely online.

After the Clooneys made their announcement, other Hollywood leaders said they would match their donation to help the March for Our Lives, including the producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife, Marilyn, Oprah Winfrey, and Steven Spielberg and his wife, Kate Capshaw.

These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said weve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard, Ms. Winfrey said on Twitter.

            George and Amal, I couldnt agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to March For Our Lives. These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said weve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard.        
Sarah Chadwick, 16, one of the students organizing the nationwide protest, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that she and other organizers were so appreciative of what the Clooneys had done. Plans for the march were announced over the weekend.
Five hundred thousand dollars. Thats not pocket change, Ms. Chadwick, a junior, said. Thats a lot of money, and were so thankful he donated it to our cause.
In their statement, the Katzenbergs said: We will join Amal and George Clooney on March 24 to stand alongside these remarkable young people. We are also donating $500,000 to March for Our Lives to support this historic event.

In announcing their $500,000 donation, Mr. Spielberg and Ms. Capshaw said, The young students in Florida and now across the country are already demonstrating their leadership with a maturity that belies their ages.
Mr. and Mrs. Clooneys announcement came six months after they donated $1 million, through their Clooney Foundation for Justice, to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization in Montgomery, Ala., that tracks extremist groups.
Stan Rosenfield, a spokesman for Mr. Clooney, said the couples donation on Tuesday was made by them personally and did not come from their foundation.

It started last month as a writing exercise on the 1963 Birmingham Childrens Crusade, when more than 1,000 students skipped school and marched to demand civil rights. Then the class assignment mushroomed into a plan  hatched by 10- and 11-year-olds  to stage a little civil disobedience of their own.
So on Wednesday morning, the students in Craig Sampsells fifth-grade class at Case Elementary School in Akron, Ohio, will pick up posters they drew and walk out of their classrooms, joining many thousands of other students in a nationwide protest against gun violence after the killing of 17 people in a Florida high school last month.
Asked whether that was an appropriate age to be protesting about a disturbing event, the principal, Danjile Henderson, said: My fifth-grade students were very aware of the details of the events and wanted to have their own peaceful protest.
Still, she drew lines around who could participate and how. Third through fifth graders may walk out; second graders can observe, but not walk; kindergartners and first-grade students will remain in class for discussions on school safety in general that avoid the shooting itself. Not all parents may want that detailed conversation on what happened in Florida, Ms. Henderson said.

With some parents wanting their children to get firsthand exposure to a nationwide political demonstration; others worried that the protests are stoking the fears of young children about a threat that remains uncommon; and still others objecting to the gun-control message entirely, one question has been weighing heavily on school administrators this past week: How young is too young for children to join the walkout?

Many districts and schools that are tolerating, if not encouraging, participation in what organizers call the National School Walkout are also calibrating their approach for their youngest students. In New York City, middle and high school students may walk out of class with approval from a parent, such as with a permission slip, but elementary school students cannot leave unless a parent or guardian comes to check them out.
At Woods Cross Elementary School in Woods Cross, Utah, students will be allowed to leave class at 10 a.m. and go to the gym for 17 minutes, the same starting time and duration (one minute for every victim in Parkland, Fla.) as other walkouts around the country. Parents may also check them out of the school during that time, and they will not be penalized.
Were giving them an opportunity to express their First Amendment rights in a safe place, said Rachel Peterson, a physical education teacher at the school who is also safety commissioner for the state board of the Utah PTA.
In suburban Nashville, David L. Snowden, director of schools for the Franklin Special School District, sent an email to families saying that the district had decided that it would not be appropriate for students in its elementary schools, which run through fourth grade, to participate in the walkout, but that students in grades five and up could join.
In an interview, Dr. Snowden said he was not concerned that very young children would be frightened by the walkout, only that they would not understand what it was about. Sometimes I think when youre teaching children, especially younger children, you try to take into consideration, will there be a full understanding of what theyre doing and why theyre doing it, he said. Just to walk out of class for 17 minutes, Im not sure what that is really teaching.
Even within Akrons 50-school district, agendas for Wednesday differed markedly from school to school. At Firestone Park Elementary, students were expected to read a poem about peace. At Pfeiffer Elementary, students would be reviewing safety procedures. And at Robinson Community Learning Center there were no plans at all  students had not expressed an interest, according to the district.
Elise Cappella, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at New York Universitys Steinhardt School, said there was a difference between what the youngest students  from kindergarten to second grade  and older children could understand. While not advocating any particular stance, she said: Schools could make the decision that kids in kindergarten through second grade are not provided the opportunity to walk out. They are cognitively, socially, emotionally younger. They may feel more fear about it and less understanding.

Children in the third grade and up, she said, will be more likely to be exposed to news and hear their parents talking about it. They are reaching a point where having something thats potentially positive and productive to do that makes them feel a sense of agency and safety could be a good thing, she said.
Ms. Cappella said that whether elementary schools decided to participate in the protest or not, the goal should be to project a sense of community to their students. And if you can create that space, she said, whether thats in the classroom or in the hallways or in the schoolyard or out at a protest or a march, thats the most beneficial space for young kids to be in.

Some school districts are trying to discourage any type of school walkout, regardless of age, warning that any student who participates will be marked as absent from class or even disciplined.
In Sayreville, N.J., where students have been threatened with suspension if they walk out, the president of the school board, Kevin Ciak, said at a meeting last month that if we decide that we open this door, we open this door to allow students to basically walk out and protest anything.
Barbara P. Canavan, the schools superintendent in Harford County, Md., said that a walkout presents, paradoxically, a threat to student safety, as word of the walkout has been widely disseminated and students who go outside could become more vulnerable.
Instead, Ms. Canavan said, her district would offer a learning module that will provide students with an opportunity to share their feelings about recent events across the nation and will allow them to speak about solutions in a structured way.
The American Civil Liberties Union, which has offered training to students planning to participate in the walkouts, said that districts can discipline students under attendance guidelines.
But what they cant do, the A.C.L.U. wrote in a guide for student protesters, is discipline you more harshly because of the political nature of or the message behind your action.
Even some schools where demonstrations are being allowed are being careful about the tone.
Ms. Peterson, of Woods Cross in Utah, said that there was no program planned for the assembly  the students would be able to express themselves as long as they were not rowdy or disruptive. We are teachers and not necessarily there to make a political statement in that time, she said. Whatever is decided by students in that time and space, we will allow it to happen as long as it is peaceable and respectful.

If some students who stayed behind expressed surprise or bafflement at their classmates leaving the room, she said, teachers would use their own tact and judgment about how to explain it. The way I would word it is that some kids are walking out to show support for lessening school violence, in honor of the people in Florida, Ms. Peterson said.
But in Alexandria, Va., when one school decided that fifth graders could join the walkout if their parents signed them out, a parent lodged her own form of protest.

            This is being organized by groups that want to ban all guns and are demanding congress act. Kids shouldnt be used as props.        
My elementary school has 5-year-olds in it, the parent, Julie Gunlock, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Independent Womens Forum, said in an interview. Some of my friends, their kids are much younger than a fifth grader. And its frightening to them.
Maeva Lile, 11, one of the fifth-grade organizers at Case Elementary in Akron, said that most of her friends were aware of the gun-control debate and thought that AR-15s, the powerful rifle used in Parkland and other mass shootings, should not be legal. But she said her class did not want to debate the Second Amendment, and so its posters will simply honor the students killed in Parkland with their names.
Still, she thought it was time for children to do something. Adults have been protesting against things, she said on Monday, but nothing has changed that much.

It is not just in Florida where the mass shooting at a high school is prompting lawmakers to take up gun control legislation. The same thing is happening across the country, from Washington to Vermont.
What was one of the deadliest school shootings in modern American history prompted Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island to sign an executive order on Monday to establish a policy to take guns away from people who pose a danger to themselves or others.
If the federal government wont act, states need to do more to prevent the gun violence that has become far too common, Ms. Raimondo, a Democrat, said in signing the measure.
Many of these measures to address gun violence come as students around the nation, accustomed to inaction in Congress, have begun protesting. The most vocal have been the survivors of the shooting, which left 17 dead in Florida on Feb. 14.
Advertisement
Still, not all states are moving to toughen gun laws. Some states are considering action to loosen regulations. Here is a roundup of what states are considering doing or have already done.
Advertisement
Governor Raimondos move by executive order was the first of its kind. Five other states  Connecticut, California, Washington, Oregon and Indiana  have passed similar extreme risk laws, sometimes known as red flag laws, having done so either in the legislature or by voter referendum. Since the Florida shooting, a dozen others are considering similar measures.
Rhode Island has also joined with Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York in a coalition to combat gun violence. The group plans to create a multistate database to trace and intercept guns used in crimes or transported across state lines.
Lawmakers have proposed a  package of gun measures that defy the powerful National Rifle Association, but fall well short of the more restrictive measures, like an assault weapons ban, favored by the shootings survivors.
Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, proposed raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles to 21 and called for a raft of measures he said could keep mentally ill or violent people from purchasing weapons and keep schools safer. Republicans in the House and Senate, who appear supportive of Mr. Scotts proposals, also called for a three-day waiting period on the purchase of those weapons, which already exists for those who wish to buy handguns.
Mr. Scott proposed $450 million in new funding for school security and $50 million in mental health funding and called for a law enforcement officer to be posted in every public school.
Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, has done an about-face in his rural state, where hunting is a major pastime and which has some of the most lax gun laws in the country. Even after the shooting, he told the Vermont publication Seven Days that he saw no need for changing laws. I believe our gun laws are balanced, said Mr. Scott, who has a 93 percent rating from the N.R.A.
But shortly after, a student at a Vermont high school was accused of planning a  mass shooting. Mr. Scott said he was jolted by the prospect of such a disaster so close to home.

The reality of how close we came to a devastating tragedy underscores the threat of violence that faces the entire country, he said. As a result, Ive been asking myself, Are we doing everything we can to protect our kids?
Now, he said, Everything should be on the table at this point.
The State Senate is expected to pass two measures this week to tighten gun controls. The Senate Judiciary Committee last week unanimously passed one bill  to allow law enforcement to remove guns from people considered at extreme risk of harming themselves or others.
The committee was divided on the second, more controversial bill  an expansion of background checks  but in an unusual step, appeared ready to allow it to move to the Senate floor without a committee vote. The State House is likely to take up the two measures later next month.
The day after the shooting, Oregons House passed a bill making it illegal for people convicted of domestic violence or those with restraining orders against them to possess weapons, even if they are not married to, do not live with, or do not have children with their victims.
One of the three Republicans who joined Democrats in voting for the bill said pressure from groups like the N.R.A. made him want to crawl under my desk in the fetal position, according to The Oregonian. The State Senate passed the bill late last week; Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, is expected to sign it.
It took the voices and outrage of youth devastated by gun violence to hold decision makers feet to the fire, she said in a statement.
A bill filed in Washington State on Friday would raise the minimum age to purchase a semiautomatic rifle or shotgun with tactical features to 21, which the bills sponsors said would align rules to buy those guns with existing rules for handguns. It would also make the sale of those weapons subject to state and federal background checks.
The bill would also create a program to allow students to report threats or potentially violent activity anonymously to the attorney generals office and would require the state to give grants to school districts for emergency response systems.

Lawmakers in Washington are also working on a ban on bump stocks, which accelerate the rate of fire on semiautomatic firearms. The legislation passed the Senate in January and the House on Friday, with a final Senate vote remaining.
Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, has appointed a committee to propose concrete actions and urged it to make its recommendations quickly.
Meanwhile, several bills, some restricting access to guns and some expanding it, are pending in the Statehouse.

Michael J. Madigan, the House speaker, said he would schedule votes this week on two gun-related bills that were filed before the shooting. One would require gun dealers to be licensed, much like car dealerships or beauty salons. The other, similar to the extreme risk laws in other states, allows a judge to bar a person from possessing weapons if family members or law enforcement officers ask the court to do so.
Mr. Madigan said lawmakers this week would also introduce legislation to raise the minimum age to purchase military-style assault rifles to 21.
Some bills loosening gun restrictions have advanced in the state since the Florida shooting, according to The Indianapolis Star. A Senate committee last week advanced a bill that would do away with a $125 fee for a lifetime license to carry a handgun, and would increase from four years to five years a permit that exempts holders from background checks when purchasing a handgun.
In the House, a committee passed a bill last week allowing people to carry weapons at churches that share property with schools, as long as they are working for or attending the church, and the church does not prohibit weapons. This month, before the shooting, the measure was passed by the full Senate.
The state is considering legislation to lower the age at which people can carry hidden, loaded guns in public to 18 from 21, while also requiring anyone under 21 to get a permit, including for carrying their weapons on college campuses. The State House passed the measure earlier this month. It is now before the State Senate.
The House has passed a measure that the N.R.A. calls self-defense legislation. It would let people carry guns on the grounds of schools or churches. The Senate is considering a bill to repeal the permitting process to allow law-abiding citizens to carry a weapon without having to get a concealed-carry permit.

After the shooting, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, sent a letter to Mike Morath, the Texas Education Agency commissioner, ordering safety information to be distributed to all schools, and asking him to take steps to ensure that all schools have completed safety audits and that all have a multihazard emergency plan in place.

With each mass shooting, calls rise from gun control advocates for tighter rules on firearms. The go-to policy prescription involves background checks. But a measure passed by the House and being considered in the Senate to expand the National Instant Criminal Background Check System would not only fail to fix major flaws in the system but would also probably introduce new ones.
Lawmakers from both parties acknowledge that errors in the background check system let felons obtain guns, as we saw when a deranged man, Devin Kelley, killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., in November. The killer, while in the Air Force, had been convicted of domestic violence in 2012, involuntarily committed to a mental health care center and given a bad conduct discharge. Yet the Air Force failed to follow policies to ensure that his conviction was reported to federal law enforcement, which allowed the killer to pass the check. The military has failed to report other such cases.
The background check measures before Congress aim to improve enforcement of existing law and increase such reporting by imposing financial penalties on government officials whose agencies fail to provide required information. Thats a good goal, but any proposal should also fix another major problem with the background check system: false positives that stop law-abiding people from getting weapons that they might need to protect themselves and their families.
The background check system confuses the names of law-abiding individuals with those of criminals, resulting in thousands of false positives every year. Relying on phonetically similar names along with birth dates just doesnt allow for much accuracy.
Ronnie Coleman, a Virginia resident, was not allowed to buy a gun in 2012 because another person from his hometown in Texas who had a felony conviction also had a name and birth date close enough to his to cause a denial. Mr. Coleman was advised to get a unique transaction number from the background system to prevent this confusion in the future, adding another bureaucratic step to the process.
Between 2006 to 2010, the last period for which more comprehensive annual data  on the denial of firearm applications by the background check system are available, there were 377,283 denials. But the federal government prosecuted only 460 of those cases, leading to 209 convictions, mostly on charges of providing false information. There was a similarly small number of state prosecutions resulting from the gun purchase denials.
Why didnt more of those denials lead to perjury prosecutions? According to my analysis, the reason is simple: a high percentage of cases are dropped because the applicant was wrongly denied clearance to buy a gun.
Many of those people are trying to buy guns to protect themselves. This incredibly high rate of false positives imposes a real burden on the most vulnerable people, said Reagan Dunn, the first national coordinator for Project Safe Neighborhoods, a Justice Department program started in 2001 to ensure gun laws are enforced.
The system also does a poor job of accounting for people who have had their rights to buy a firearm taken away and then restored. In the 1990s, Frank Wise of Jacksonville Beach, Fla., was convicted of check fraud after his employer went bankrupt. When his paycheck bounced, two checks he sent to his mortgage company also bounced. Nearly 20 years later, Mr. Wise was able to get his record cleared, but that information wasnt entered into the background check system for three years. Getting this fixed cost him $3,600 in legal fees.
Even more people would face such problems if background checks were made universal, meaning to include the private sale or transfer of firearms, which are exempt from checks in most states. Many people consider this a common-sense policy, but there would be a cost: Background checks involve fees that drive up the price of guns in private sales and make it harder for poor people to defend themselves.
To get some idea of what background checks add to the price of a weapon, look at the fees for checks on private transfers in states that already impose checks. In New York City and Washington, those fees cost at least $125 for private gun sales.
If people believe that background checks reduce crime and benefit everyone, everyone should pay for it, out of general government revenue. Pushing background checks on private transfers as proposed during the hearing disarms many law-abiding poor people.
So what should be done when the background check system fails to stop mass killers from attacking? One answer is to have more civilians carry permitted concealed handguns. Those law-abiding gun owners can help protect places where there are no police. In 2013, PoliceOne, a news and resource site for active and retired law enforcement officers, released a survey finding that over 91 percent of the more than 15,000 verified law enforcement professionals who responded supported concealed carry.
We do need to fix the background check system. But lets really fix it. Lets make sure that rare cases like Devin Kelley cant slip through the cracks, but lets also make sure that the government stops preventing millions of law-abiding citizens from buying guns for protection. Adding more names without fixing these problems will only disarm law-abiding Americans.

Elon, N.C.
Lapeer, Mich.
Allendale, N.J.
Parkland, Fla.
Noblesville, Ind.
Newtown, Conn.
A month ago, hundreds of teenagers ran for their lives from the hallways and classrooms of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and staff had been shot to death.
On Wednesday, driven by the conviction that they should never have to run from guns again, they walked.
So did their peers. In New York City, in Chicago, in Atlanta and Santa Monica; at Columbine High School and in Newtown, Conn.; and in many more cities and towns, students left school by the hundreds and the thousands at 10 a.m., sometimes in defiance of school authorities, who seemed divided and even flummoxed about how to handle their emptying classrooms.
The first major coordinated action of the student-led movement for gun control marshaled the same elements that had defined it ever since the Parkland shooting: eloquent young voices, equipped with symbolism and social media savvy, riding a resolve as yet untouched by cynicism.
Advertisement
We have grown up watching more tragedies occur and continuously asking: Why? said Kaylee Tyner, a 16-year-old junior at Columbine High School outside Denver, where 13 people were killed in 1999, inaugurating, in the public consciousness, the era of school shootings. Why does this keep happening?
Advertisement
Even after a year of near continuous protesting  for women, for the environment, for immigrants and more  the emergence of people not even old enough to drive as a political force has been particularly arresting, unsettling a gun control debate that had seemed impervious to other factors.
In Florida, where students from Stoneman Douglas High and other schools had rallied in the state capital, the governor signed a bill last week that raised the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21 and extended the waiting period to three days.
On a national level, the students have not had the same impact. This week, President Trump abandoned gun control proposals that the Republican-led Congress had never even inched toward supporting.
But, for one day at least, the students commanded the countrys airwaves, Twitter feeds and Snapchat stories.
Principals and superintendents seemed disinclined to stop them. Some were outright supportive, though others warned that students would face disciplinary consequences for leaving school. At many schools, teachers and parents joined in.
Wreathed in symbolism, the walkouts generally lasted for 17 minutes, one for each of the Parkland victims. Two more nationwide protests are set to take place on March 24 and on April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine shooting.
On a soccer field burned yellow by the Colorado sun, Ms. Tyner stood alongside hundreds of her fellow students, who waved signs  This is our future, one said  and released red, white and blue balloons.

Yet in many places, for many students, Wednesday was just Wednesday, and class went on. Even at Columbine, the embrace of the gun control movement was not universal.
People say its all about gun control, its all about, We should ban guns, said Caleb Conrad, 16, a junior, who stayed in class. But thats not the real issue here. The real issue is the people who are doing it.
In the one-school rural community of Potosi, Wis., no student group had organized a protest. After a handful of students expressed some interest, the school decided to hold an assembly at 10 a.m. to talk about school safety measures and the value of being kind to one another.
At 10 a.m., one student, a female freshman, left the building alone.
Throughout the assembly, she sat by herself outside, by a flagpole, for 17 minutes. She appeared to be praying, said the principal, Mike Uppena, adding that she was not in trouble for leaving.
Officials in Lafayette Parish, La., initially said that students could participate in the days events, believing that it was appropriate to honor the Florida victims. But when it became clear there was a political motive to the walkout, a torrent of complaints from the local community led the school board to adopt a new plan: a minute of silence.
Dozens of students walked out anyway.
In some places, demonstrators chanted and held signs. At other schools, students stood in silence. In Atlanta, some students took a knee.
Thousands of New York City students converged on central locations  Columbus Circle, Battery Park, Brooklyn Borough Hall, Lincoln Center.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, stretched out on the sidewalk as part of a die-in with students in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, the former home of the Occupy Wall Street protests.

Hundreds sat in the middle of West 62nd Street for several minutes before rising to their feet and shouting, No more violence. A cry of Trump Tower! sent dozens of protesters marching toward the Trump International Hotel and Tower across Broadway. Onlookers gave them fist-bumps.
In Washington, thousands left their classrooms in the city and its suburbs and marched to the Capitol steps, their high-pitched voices battling against the stiff wind: Hey-hey, ho-ho, the N.R.A. has got to go! One sign said: Fix This, Before I Text My Mom from Under A Desk.
Members of Congress, overwhelmingly Democratic, emerged from the Capitol to meet them. Trailed by aides and cameras, some legislators high-fived the children in the front rows, others took selfies, and nearly all soon learned that the young protesters had no idea who they were.
Except, of course, for BERNIE SANDERS! which the protesters screamed at the Vermont senator, as well at some other white-haired, bespectacled legislators.
Asked by reporters about the walkouts, Raj Shah, Mr. Trumps deputy press secretary, said the president shares the students concerns about school safety and cited his support for mental health and background check improvements.
As the hours passed, the walkouts moved west across the country.
Its 10 oclock, said a man on the intercom at Perspectives Charter Schools on Chicagos South Side. With that, hundreds of students streamed out of their classrooms and into the neighborhood, marching past modest brick homes, a Walgreens and multiple churches.
Several current and former Perspectives students have been killed in recent years, the school president said.
You see different types of violence going on, said Armaria Broyles, a junior who helped lead the walkout and whose older brother was killed in a shooting. We all want a good community and we all want to make a change.

At Santa Monica High School in Southern California, teachers guided hundreds of students to the football field. It felt like a cross between a political rally and pep rally, with dozens of students wearing orange T-shirts, the color of the gun control movement, and #neveragain scrawled onto their arms in black eyeliner.
It is our duty to win, Roger Gawne, a freshman and one of the protest organizers, yelled to the crowd.
The protests calling for stricter gun control measures come on the heels of other youth movements, but the momentum they have gained makes them stand out.
Although the walkouts commanded attention on cable television and social media for much of Wednesday, it also was clear that many students did not participate, especially in rural and conservative areas where gun control is not popular.
At Bartlesville High School in Bartlesville, Okla., where hundreds of students walked out of class last month to protest cuts in state education funding, nothing at all happened at 10 a.m.
I havent heard a word about it, the principal, LaDonna Chancellor, said of the gun protest.
In Iowa, Russell Reiter, superintendent of the Oskaloosa Community School District, suggested that temperatures below 40 degrees may have encouraged students to stay indoors, but he also said that students here are just not interested in what is going on in bigger cities.
There was opposition even in liberal Santa Monica. Just after the organizers of the walkout there read the names of the Parkland victims, another student went on stage, grabbed the microphone and shouted Support the Second Amendment! before he was called off by administrators.
Some of the days most poignant demonstrations happened at schools whose names are now synonymous with shootings.
Watched by a phalanx of reporters, camera operators and supporters, hundreds of students crowded onto the football field at Stoneman Douglas High shortly after 10 a.m.

A month after the Feb. 14 shooting, notes of condolence, fading flowers and stuffed toys, damp from recent rain, still lay on the grass outside the school and affixed to metal fences.
The walkout was allowed by the school, but several students said they were warned that they would not be permitted back onto the campus for the day if they left school grounds. Despite the warning, a couple of hundred students marched to a nearby park for another demonstration.
We need more than just 17 minutes, Nicolle Montgomerie, 17, a junior, said as she walked toward the park.
An email from the school soon went out telling students they could return.
In Newtown, Conn., where 26 people were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, hundreds of students at Newtown High School gathered in a parking lot near the football field. Two hours later, it was Columbines turn.
Shortly after the walkouts began, the National Rifle Association said on Twitter, Lets work together to secure our schools and stop school violence.

            Let's work together to secure our schools and stop school violence. We protect our banks, our sports stadiums and our government buildings better than we protect our schools. That must change. #StopSchoolViolenceAct #DefendTheSecond #NRA pic.twitter.com/98dWIv0giM 
But the next tweet left no doubt as to where the N.R.A. stood on the message of the protests. It said, Ill control my own guns, thank you. #2A #NRA atop a photo of an AR-15, the kind of high-powered rifle used at Stoneman Douglas High and in other mass shootings.

            I'll control my own guns, thank you. #2A #NRA pic.twitter.com/jqbZzwcWf6 
The Gun Owners of America, a smaller organization often seen as more militant than the N.R.A., was more defiant.
The group urged its supporters to call their elected officials to oppose gun control measures like Fix NICS, which is intended to improve reporting by state and federal agencies to the criminal background check system. We could win or lose the gun control battle in the next 96 hours, the group said on Twitter.

The group also celebrated the pro-gun students who are not supporting their anti-gun counterparts.

            Kudos to the pro-gun students who are not supporting their anti-gun counterparts. #NationalWalkoutDay pic.twitter.com/DyKoRHrL1n 
Some schools accommodated or even encouraged the protests. But others warned that they would mark students who left as absent, or even suspend them.

In Cobb County, Ga., near Atlanta, the threat of punishment did not keep scores of Walton High School students from standing in silence on the football field for 170 seconds. A school district spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on what would happen to the students.
Noelle Ellerson Ng, associate executive director for policy and advocacy for AASA, the association of the nations superintendents, said that schools had to balance the First Amendment rights of students with their other responsibilities, including safety.
Indeed, several protests were canceled because of threats of the same kind of violence the students were demonstrating against. A demonstration at Broughton High School in Raleigh, N.C., was called off when the principal learned of what she later described as a false rumor of a threat and a post on social media that caused unnecessary fear among our school community.

In the wake of this weeks devastation in Las Vegas, it is important to remember that this kind of headline-grabbing mass shooting constitutes only a tiny fraction of the gun murders in our country. There were over 8,000 gunshot homicides in 2014, according to the F.B.I.s most recent calculations, and gun violence is the first and second leading cause of death for African-American and Latino males between ages 15 and 34.
Many have thrown up their hands in despair over these numbers, but the good news is that proven strategies to protect people from being murdered by firearms do exist. The bad news: Theyre tragically underutilized, for reasons that we suspect have to do with a dismissive national attitude toward the areas where most acts of violence are committed.
In the 1990s, a highly effective gun violence reduction strategy was developed in Boston by a group including law enforcement officers, researchers, and black clergy members. According to the National Institute of Justice, it resulted in a 63 percent reduction in the average monthly number of youth homicide victims in that city, an accomplishment that was called the Boston Miracle.
Since then, variations of that strategy have been implemented in cities across the country. For example, according to a study by the Campbell Collaboration, a nonprofit organization that evaluates the effects of this type of intervention, Stockton, Calif., saw a 42 percent reduction in its monthly count of gun homicides in the first year of the strategys implementation; similarly, Oakland, Calif., saw just under a 30 percent reduction. (In 2017, the city is on track to have its second-lowest homicide rate in over 30 years.)
While movies, television and news outlets often give the impression that entire cities and neighborhoods are filled with thugs, criminals and killers, the reality is that those responsible for a majority of shootings represent a tiny percentage of the residents of any given city. In response to this fact, effective gun violence reduction strategies adopt a highly targeted, data-based approach in which the small number of individuals most at risk for shooting (and being shot) are provided with individualized programs of support and pressure to lay down their guns. To this end, law enforcement officials, clergy members, community leaders, social service providers and mentors who have themselves escaped violent lifestyles work in partnership with one another to help these individuals turn their lives around.
Part of the beauty of this approach is that unlike tactics such as stop and frisk policing, these strategies do not eat away at already fractured relationships between law enforcement and communities of color. Instead, they harness the leadership and experience of the people who live in and understand these communities. Unlike the national gun violence prevention policy efforts, which tend to be led by progressive white groups and individuals, they ensure that those who are directly affected  mostly people of color  decide how peacemaking and anti-violence initiatives are carried out.
Given the positive results, many astutely ask why these approaches have not been implemented more widely. The central answer is that the high death tolls in urban communities of color have proved to be socially and politically acceptable to mainstream America. For some reason, while mass shootings like the one we saw in Las Vegas are widely seen as symptomatic of a national problem, the continuing scourge of killings in our cities isnt. The result is that neither Democratic nor Republican Justice Departments have funded these types of violence reduction strategies on a large scale.
Absent a targeted investment strategy from the federal government, some local communities have taken on the challenge for themselves. In most cases, this has been made possible through relatively small reallocations of city or county funds. Police departments in urban areas often account for large percentages of city budgets but end up spending more time and resources trying to solve murders rather than working to prevent them. The RAND Corporation estimates that a single murder costs the community over $8 million in court, police, hospital, incarceration and other expenditures. Even the most fiscally conservative among us can agree that a $1 million to $2 million investment at the city or county level would more than pay for itself with even minimal homicide decreases.
But even in cases in which cities have re-prioritized their funding and seen significant decreases in homicides, the strategy has been vulnerable to changing political winds. A new police chief, a new mayor or even the infighting of community-based organizations can disrupt the fragile political equilibrium that supports the work. So, what we have found is that focused and relentless community organizing is vital to helping ensure that the most vulnerable communities are able to demand the most effective strategies for keeping their neighborhoods safe  regardless of who is in office. To that end, we work with the clergy, youth, parents of murdered sons and daughters, police departments and government officials in cities and counties around the country to ensure that effective, lifesaving strategies are in place.
It would be one thing if the solution to gun violence in our country were as elusive as the cure for cancer. But thats not the case. The effective solutions exist and are simply not being funded or supported. While the left and the right continue to argue about gun control and gun rights, it would be refreshing to see some bipartisan support at the federal, state and local levels for programs that can get results right now, because in cities across our country, gun murders every bit as tragic as the ones that took place in Las Vegas are happening every day.

True to the Game presents a Philadelphia parable. Gena (Erica Peeples) is an aspiring writer, Quadir (Columbus Short) is a cocaine kingpin. Their love promises a new beginning, but there may be no way to exit a life on the streets. Based on the Teri Woods novel of the same name, the hustlers of True to the Game are trapped in a world of twists and treachery. But though Ms. Woodss novel was a resonant entry in the crime genre when it came out nearly 20 years ago, this adaptation lacks the vision to find a fresh angle on her story. Its all too easy to guess which characters will be marked for tragedy and which characters will learn from their loss.
In the best circumstances, the familiarity of the crime genre can provide an opportunity for a filmmaker to flex their point of view, but the direction, by Preston A. Whitmore II, seems hampered by either a lack of resources or a lack of interest. The camera lingers on expensive cars, but club scenes appear threadbare. Quadir and his rivals are supposedly the toughest high rollers in the game, but their virility is primarily conveyed through their conspicuously manicured beards. Among the actors, Vivica A. Fox commands a cameo appearance with an authority and charisma that outweighs any of the movies leads  including Mr. Shorts Quadir. And Nelsan Ellis, in one of his last film roles, is underutilized as Quadirs cutthroat second-in-command. To its detriment, True to the Game tries to reform kingpins before it maximizes on its own investments.

To the Editor:
Re Repeal the Second Amendment (column, nytimes.com, Oct. 5):
Politics is the art of the possible, and Bret Stephenss suggestion of repeal is not possible. However, it may be possible to replace the Second Amendment in a way that clarifies both the right of Americans to own guns and the powers of the government to regulate that right. It could read as follows:
The right of individuals to keep and bear arms consistent with the purpose of self-defense shall not be infringed. Congress and the states shall have the power to regulate the possession, ownership, sale, production and transportation of arms and ammunition, provided that such regulations do not infringe the right of individuals to keep and bear arms consistent with the purpose of self-defense.
Advocates of gun control would support this amendment because it clarifies that the government has authority to regulate gun ownership. Advocates of gun owners rights might support the amendment because it enshrines their right to own guns for self-defense.
If we can get both groups on board, we can make this happen, and we can begin the work of making America safer.
DENNIS CANFIELDWESTERN SPRINGS, ILL.
To the Editor:
Bret Stephens asserts that the National Rifle Association has donated a paltry $3,533,294 to all current members of Congress since 1998, citing a chart published in The Washington Post. But that chart counts only direct contributions, and therefore does not include money that the N.R.A. has spent on behalf of specific candidates.
As The Times has  reported, the N.R.A. has spent more than $7 million on behalf of a single senator (John McCain) over his career. The Los Angeles Times  reports that the N.R.A. spent $54.4 million on all political campaigns in the 2016 election cycle.
Mr. Stephens is correct that the N.R.A.s influence is not limited to the money it spends on behalf of politicians. But hes wrong to suggest that the N.R.A.s political spending is paltry  and that it doesnt make a difference. It does.
DANIEL LERMAN, WASHINGTON
To the Editor:
When it was reported that the Las Vegas shooter had multiple guns acquired legally, one thought came to mind. There should be a national database of gun sales so that when a person goes to buy a gun, he cannot take possession of it until the database is viewed.
Obviously, criteria that raise a red flag would have to be established  number purchased over a period of time, type of guns, etc. (I leave this to the experts.) I know that such a database would not prevent these atrocities completely, but I think it would make them harder to carry out.
SAUL EISENSTAT, CARMEL, CALIF.
To the Editor:
In all the news coverage of the Las Vegas shooting, where is any footage from the hotels own security cameras to confirm the single-shooter theory? If this were a teenager robbing a corner store, the television and the internet would be blasting as many videos from surveillance cameras as possible.

Every so often in The Dark Tower, you catch a glimpse of what might have been: the might-have-been narrative ambition, the might-have-been pop mythology, the might-have-been genre assemblage. Based  loosely seems altogether too generous a word  on the Stephen King series, the movie is an unappealing hash of moviemaking clichés that, after much scurrying and blathering, devolves into a generic shootem-up. About the only thing holding it together is Idris Elba, whose irrepressible magnetism and man-of-stone solidity anchors this mess but cant redeem it.
Mr. Elba plays the otherworldly Roland, whose name suggests the Arthurian legend with knights and so forth. Onscreen, though, Roland basically points, shoots and serves as an overqualified babysitter for Jake (Tom Taylor), a 14-year-old with psychic powers (he shines à la The Shining) who lives here and now on what Roland calls Keystone Earth. Roland, by contrast, lives in Mid-World, an incoherent realm of foggy woods, digital boogeymen, cinematic allusions, slavering nods to Mr. Kings voluminous oeuvre and some geological formations that may cause you to uselessly flash on images from John Ford westerns. (The movie was partly shot in the Cederberg Mountains in South Africa.)
For reasons that emerge in expository blurts, Jake and Roland travel between Mid-World and the considerably less interesting Keystone Earth. Also on the move is Walter, a.k.a. the man in black (Matthew McConaughey), an amusingly dissolute supervillain who, with weary hand waves and insinuating whispers, oozes about like a Vegas lounge lizard  with a hint of the Wicked Witch of the West snap – lording over heavily armed, face-changing, blood-lusting snarlers (Jackie Earle Haley, et. al). Mr. McConaughey, topped by an artfully arranged shock of black hair and flashing some tanned chest that makes you want to whip out the gold chains, has truly developed into a Zen master of sleaze.
The title refers to a mysteriously woo-woo, sky-piercingly tall spire that somehow holds both the universes various worlds and its monstrous threats in check. Walter wants to destroy the dark tower; Roland intends to protect it. Jake, who tends to look as confused as the audience may feel, doesnt yet have a mission, though giving this twerp a purpose  a kind of wee heros journey (Surrender, Jake!)  seems to be the endgame. Its a default solution, and reads like a cop-out. After all, if Stephen King hands you a complex fiction that turns pulpy tropes into a dense mythology with its own language and heavyweight heroes like Roland, wouldnt you run with at least some of it?
The Dark Tower series can be traced to Mr. Kings love of, among other inspirations, J. R. R. Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings novels as well as Sergio Leones masterly 1966 film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, which I suppose explains the duster Roland wears and an empty nod to spaghetti westerns. So, theres that. Mostly, there are clotted action scenes, gun fetishism, bad writing and stop-and-go rhythms that suggest a longer version may once have existed. The director, Nikolaj Arcel, shares screenwriting credit and blame with Akiva Goldsman, Jeff Pinkner and Anders Thomas Jensen; whatever they thought they were doing here remains as mysterious as Walters hair product.

WASHINGTON  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday that the Justice Department was proposing to ban so-called bump stocks through regulations rather than wait for Congress to act, a move that defies recommendations by federal law enforcement officials and could subject the department to litigation from gun rights groups.
Mr. Sessionss announcement came moments after President Trump said on Twitter that the Justice Department would imminently announce a rule banning bump stocks.

            Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.        
It also comes amid rising public pressure on Washington to curb gun violence after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead last month. Students will gather Saturday in Washington to protest gun violence for an event called March for Our Lives.
The Justice Departments proposed rule would define machine gun to include bump-stock-type devices under federal law  effectively banning them, Mr. Sessions said in a statement.

The proposed bump stock ban would defy the conclusion of Justice Department officials who have said that they could not, under existing law, stop the sales of bump stocks, accessories that allow semiautomatic guns to mimic automatic fire, and that congressional action was needed to ban them. But Mr. Sessions said the department had worked around those concerns.
Advertisement
After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, Mr. Sessions said, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.
The 55-page proposal, which was published for public comment, said it was redefining machine guns to include bump stocks because such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.
The proposal would force bump stock owners to surrender or destroy them the day the rule would go into effect.
A previous Justice Department review, done by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was prompted by the mass shooting last fall in Las Vegas, where a gunman killed 58 people using semiautomatic weapons outfitted with bump stocks.
By working around the A.T.F.s earlier interpretation, the Justice Department essentially said that the statute had not changed, but that it could now be read in a different way.
By reinterpreting the conclusion that was made under President Barack Obama, the Justice Department could open itself up to lawsuits when the rule is finalized. Litigation would tie up the bump stock ban in the courts.
Legal experts say that groups that sue could win because bump stock makers specifically designed the devices so they could not qualify as machine guns under the law.

When you pull the trigger once on a machine gun, multiple bullets fire, whereas each pull of a trigger fires a single round with bump stocks, said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston. People designed it this way deliberately to keep bump stocks from being defined as machine guns under the statute. Its like the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. The first is specifically to avoid being illegal.
Advertisement
The controversial new rule is in keeping with Mr. Sessionss practice of closely hewing to White House political directives, sometimes remaining silent in the face of criticism from Mr. Trump and other times rebuking his own employees.
Before the Justice Department issued any measures of its own, Mr. Trump had publicly declared that he would use executive authority to ban bump stocks, and he ordered the department to find a way to prohibit them.
This month, the Justice Department announced an array of initiatives designed to address the issue of gun violence, sometimes echoing measures that had already been proposed by Mr. Trump.
The department said it would help local law enforcement officials hire more school resource officers, help local firearms training programs work with teachers and help states provide faster, more accurate and complete information to databases used in federal firearms background checks. It also said it would provide a $1 million emergency grant to Florida to help cover law enforcement costs related to the Parkland shooting.
Mr. Trump had said earlier that he supported the inclusion of mental health information in the background check system and the arming of teachers as part of an effort to deter school shootings.
Mr. Sessions also ordered federal prosecutors to more aggressively prosecute gun buyers who lie on gun purchasing applications, a move that The New York Times reported last month.
Each year, thousands of prospective gun owners who apply to buy guns through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System are found unqualified to purchase a firearm.
Advertisement
It is a felony to lie on that application, but the crime is rarely prosecuted. From 2008 to 2015, prosecutors considered fewer than 32 cases a year, according to the Justice Departments inspector general.
Under my tenure as attorney general, we have already increased federal gun prosecutions to a 10-year high  and we are just getting started, Mr. Sessions said when he announced those measures.
Those past directives acknowledged that gun violence is a problem, but they were unlikely to upset opponents of more restrictive gun policies. In the past, the National Rifle Association has supported some forms of bump-stock regulation, the enforcement of existing gun laws and some background check legislation.
But the Justice Departments latest move, which Mr. Sessions previewed in an announcement this month, will be met with more opposition.
You need Congress to pass a statute, Mr. Blackman said. Thats how you change a law, not through executive action.

Ms. Romm is a descendent of a founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer.
In the early 1880s, legend has it that Daniel B. Wesson, a co-founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer, heard about a child who injured himself by cocking the hammer and pulling the trigger of one of his firms revolvers. Wesson, known as D. B., was so distraught about the accident that he and his son, Joseph, developed a more child-safe revolver that they called the .38 Safety Hammerless.
Wesson was also my great-great-great-grandfather. Though it has been half a century since my family was involved with Smith & Wesson, I feel a twinge of responsibility every time a mass shooting occurs. I realize this is not entirely rational: I play no part in making or selling firearms and have never lost anyone close to me from gun violence. But it still haunts me.
After 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., I learned the shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P 15, a version of an AR-15 military-style rifle. So I had to ask myself: What would D. B. Wesson have wanted his company to do? Would he have accepted the repeated refrain, Guns dont kill people, people kill people?
Obviously I cannot know what D. B. Wesson would want. But I would like to believe that he would have recoiled in horror and disbelief at the weapons created by the brand still bearing his name. And that he would have wanted all of us to ask more of his company today.
It is only fair for me, for all of us, to demand that our gun manufacturers become leaders in this national discussion around gun violence. They create products designed to kill human beings. The responsibility that must accompany the creation of weapons like an AR-15 is too large to be brushed aside by shouting about freedom and an amendment to our Constitution ratified in 1791.
Yes, the company and other gun makers have taken some steps in calling for better enforcement of the national background check system and sponsoring firearm safety programs. But they can do so much more.
I would start by asking the parent company of Smith & Wesson, American Outdoor Brands Corporation, to push for gun-violence research. Since 1996 the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been severely restricted in researching gun violence. If gun manufacturers are truly responsible organizations, they should wholeheartedly want to back this research as a public health concern. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the C.D.C. from 2009 to 2017, asked Congress repeatedly to fund research in gun-violence prevention but never succeeded.
In response to recent questions from BlackRock, an investment firm that owns the largest share of American Outdoor Brands, the gun makers president, James Debney, and chairman, Barry M. Monheit, said, We must collectively have the courage to ensure any actions are guided by data, by facts and by what will actually make us safer. Sounds like Mr. Debney, Mr. Monheit and Dr. Frieden are on the same page, so lets see Smith & Wesson lead the charge in renewing gun-violence research by the C.D.C.
I would also ask that the company publicly endorse the Brady Campaigns Gun Dealer Code of Conduct. It should support requiring universal background checks and a national registry for tracking its products, and indeed all firearms. These measures would help prevent weapons from falling into the hands of the wrong people and make it easier for law enforcement to trace guns used in illegal activities. The refrain that criminals will always get their hands on a weapon, no matter what a gun manufacturer does, is apathetic and unacceptable. What will you do to make it better?
Most obvious of all, Smith & Wesson should be pushing to require that all people who buy firearms undergo formal weapons training. Why would any responsible gun manufacturer not want a buyer trained extensively in how to properly use its very dangerous weapon?
Do more than you are doing now. Have a purpose other than making money. Take part in this national discussion. Beyond expressions of sympathy, show the families of the victims of Parkland and Newtown and Columbine and Las Vegas and every nameless gun-violence tragedy occurring every day that you care about their pain and suffering.
D. B. Wesson was a brilliant inventor who created a better gun than anyone had imagined in the 19th century. When he died in 1906, his guns had made him a multimillionaire. But he also cared deeply about the health and welfare of families and children. In his will, he left $450,000, the equivalent of more than $11 million in todays money, for a hospital specializing in homeopathic medicine that was built a few years before he died and for the construction of another hospital to provide maternity care.
If hearing about one child injured in the 1880s led him to invent the .38 Safety Hammerless, what would the more than 7,000 children killed or injured each year in the United States from gun violence stir in him? I believe if he could, he would beg the executives running Smith & Wesson today to stand up and join the fight to stop this bloodshed any way possible.
Eliza Sydnor Romm, a distant relative of a co-founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer, is a small-business owner living in North Carolina.

Meet some of the candidates for governor of Illinois attempting to unseat Bruce Rauner, a Republican and one of the most vulnerable incumbents facing election this year. They include a Kennedy and a Pritzker.
CHICAGO  Three years ago, Bruce Rauner, a multimillionaire private equity executive, charged into the governors office vowing to use an agenda and a steel backbone to transform this debt-laden state, where no Republican had been elected to the job in more than a decade.
But the bold declarations of Mr. Rauner, who arrived pledging to shake things up, have wilted some. As he runs for a second term, Mr. Rauner is one of the most vulnerable incumbent governors in the nation, having spent much of his brief political career clashing with Democrats who control the State Legislature over labor unions, taxes, the states budget and schools.
Im not in charge, the governor said after leaving an Illinois Farm Bureau conference not long ago. Im trying to get to be in charge.
Mr. Rauner, 61, who sold himself as an outsider who would bring a businessmans sensibility to the task of untangling Illinoiss political and fiscal morass, now finds himself fighting for re-election on two dizzying fronts. On the right, Jeanne Ives, a Republican legislator and Army veteran known for her hard-right stances on taxes, immigration and abortion, has forced him into a contested primary on Tuesday. And on the left, a whos who of Democratic circles wants to take on Mr. Rauner this fall, including J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire heir and entrepreneur; Chris Kennedy, a businessman and son of Robert F. Kennedy; and Daniel Biss, a suburban state senator.

It is a campaign that has hopscotched wildly from issue to issue  race, pensions, sexual harassment, clean water, guns, the flight of Illinoisans from their own state, blame for the states endless political stalemate, and more. It is on track to be among the most expensive races for governor in history, with more than $150 million raised so far, and Mr. Rauner and Mr. Pritzker sitting on vast reserves of personal wealth to pour into their campaigns. Democrats here, already holding large majorities in the Legislature, are hoping to be part of a national wave that could return control of the governorship to them as well.

Still, for all the national forces and echoes of national issues running through this race, it is in other ways just about Illinois  and this states unique brand of politics. The race, for instance, has been haunted by ghosts of governors past. Months ago, recordings emerged of old telephone conversations between Mr. Pritzker and Rod R. Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor who was accused of trying to sell the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated to become president.
On one tape from 2008, collected as part of an F.B.I. wiretapping of Mr. Blagojevich, Mr. Pritzker suggested that Mr. Blagojevich appoint Jesse White, the longtime Illinois secretary of state, who is black, to fill the empty Senate seat. On the secretly recorded conversation, Mr. Pritzker called Mr. White the least offensive choice who would provide cover on the African-American thing. Mr. Pritzker has since apologized for his comments, which have threatened to derail crucial support among black voters. (Mr. Blagojevich was convicted of corruption charges in 2011 and is currently serving a 14-year sentence at a federal prison in Colorado.)
As governor, Mr. Rauner is perhaps best known for presiding over a budget crisis that paralyzed Illinois for two years, pressing for so-called right-to-work provisions, and publicly sparring with Michael J. Madigan, the powerful Democratic speaker of the House who also serves as the chairman of the states Democratic Party. On the campaign trail, Mr. Rauner sometimes seems to be running not against his actual opponents, but against Mr. Madigan, whose longstanding, entrenched role at the center of state politics has become a matter of debate. In recent weeks, Mr. Madigan has been under intense scrutiny for his handling of sexual harassment complaints at the Capitol and in his political organization.
Mr. Rauner has wrestled with his own controversies. He recently spent a week at a state-run veterans home linked to the deaths of 13 people from Legionnaires disease in a gesture that reminded Chicagoans of the time in 1981 when then-Mayor Jane M. Byrne moved briefly  and very publicly  into the citys Cabrini-Green public housing project.
Mr. Rauner declined an interview.
Throughout his first term, Gov. Rauner has worked to grow good jobs, fight corruption and save taxpayer dollars, Will Allison, a spokesman for Mr. Rauners campaign, said in an email. The governors reform agenda is the perfect contrast to J.B. Pritzkers outspoken willingness to raise taxes and embrace one-party rule in Illinois under Mike Madigan.
Mr. Pritzker, 53, has received prized endorsements from Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and labor unions including the Illinois A.F.L.-C.I.O. After holding a campaign round table last month with Latino legislators at a Mexican restaurant in Chicagos Bucktown neighborhood, Mr. Pritzker said that he had decided to run because of his concern that the state is under siege, led by a governor who is a failure.
Mr. Pritzker, a member of a prominent Chicago family and an heir to the Hyatt hotel chain with personal wealth of $3.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine, said Mr. Rauner had fallen short of his promises to help residents of downstate Illinois, where job losses have taken a toll on the economy.

Bruce Rauner kind of put on his Carhartt jacket and tried to convince people in central and southern Illinois that hes one of them. Hes from Winnetka, Mr. Pritzker said, referring to the moneyed North Shore suburb where Mr. Rauner owns a house. He told them he was going to stand up for them, and he hasnt.
But before Mr. Pritzker has a chance to challenge Mr. Rauner, he must fend off two other leading Democratic candidates, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Biss, a task that may have become more difficult as he faces questions about his finances and after his comments on race to Mr. Blagojevich.
Mr. Kennedy, a real-estate developer, said in an interview that he had decided to run partly because of his worries over people leaving Illinois, a sign of economic decline. Mr. Rauner was given a chance to succeed and has failed, he said.
I think hes emerged as the worst governor in the history of Illinois and maybe the worst sitting governor in the United States, Mr. Kennedy said. Maybe he was a good investor, but hes a terrible C.E.O.
After Mr. Pritzkers tape-recorded conversations with Mr. Blagojevich were released, Bishop Larry Trotter, senior pastor of Sweet Holy Spirit Church on the South Side of Chicago, withdrew an invitation for Mr. Pritzker to speak to his congregation, he said, because there was such rage in the community over his remarks.
A white, wealthy man gets to say whatever he wants to say about black people and insult black people. How can he be our governor? he asked in an interview.

After meeting with Mr. Pritzker, the bishop reinstated the invitation to speak at his church, which Mr. Pritzker accepted, a spokeswoman for the candidate said.
For the moment, Mr. Rauner must contend with Ms. Ives, his Republican challenger in next weeks race. Mr. Rauner has dismissed her as a fringe candidate, but Ms. Ives, a lawmaker from suburban Wheaton who graduated from West Point, portrays herself as the true conservative in the race. She says Mr. Rauner is too moderate on social issues. She has described same-sex partnerships as completely disordered relationships that endanger children, and has rejected the idea of transgender rights, something that is made up from the media.
Ms. Ives was widely criticized for a campaign ad featuring actors playing a transgender woman, a Chicago public school teacher and a female activist wearing a pink knit pussy hat. But Ms. Ivess positions have attracted supporters like Richard Uihlein, a wealthy Illinois businessman known for championing conservative candidates, who has donated $2.5 million to her campaign.

At a bipartisan candidate forum in Chicago in January, Ms. Ives addressed the issue of gun violence.
And you know how youre going to solve it? Fathers in the home, she said, as the audience booed.
Perhaps most offended was Mr. Kennedy, who was 4 years old in 1968 when his father, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated.
Well, I wish I could agree with you. I didnt have a father in my life. Somebody shot him, he said, as audience members clapped and rose to their feet. Mr. Kennedy then walked off the stage and left the building.

Article of the Day 
By                     
 SHANNON DOYNE
 
MARCH 26, 2018

On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets in Washington and cities across the globe to take a stance against gun violence.
Before reading the article: 
Did you attend an anti-gun violence rally on Saturday? If so, what was it like? Did you see news reports of rallies that took place around the United States and in other countries? What do you think about when you look at the images from the protests?
Watch the video above. What is your reaction to what you saw and heard? Do you agree with the idea stated by one of the speakers that only teenagers could have started the movement to end gun violence? Why or why not?
Now read the article, Students Lead Huge Rallies for Gun Control Across the U.S., and answer the following questions: 
1. Roughly how many rallies took place on Saturday? Where are some of the places mentioned?
2. Why does the article suggest that the political awakening these events may serve for their participants may be a rude one?
3. Who is Naomi Wadler?
4. What does the author mean by the sentence, Calls like Naomis stood in stark contrast to action on Capitol Hill and at the White House in the hours before the rallies?
Advertisement
5. Who is John Feinblatt? What did he give as the reasons he believes that the student protesters wont become disillusioned by the lack of immediate action in Congress?
6. Where did counterprotests take place? What did speakers at those rallies talk about?
Finally, tell us more about what you think: 
The related article At Rallies, Students With a Different View of Gun Violence: As Urban Reality describes the experiences of people who attended marches on Saturday and had a different idea of the problem of gun violence: not mass shootings like the one that happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School but those shootings that are a never-ending feature of life in cities like Baltimore and Chicago.

The protests calling for stricter gun control measures come on the heels of other youth movements, but the momentum they have gained makes them stand out.
Updated: March 15, 2018
How much of a difference can young people make in addressing the problems our society faces? What makes their voices uniquely powerful?
When have youth-led movements influenced policy in the past, and what can we learn from them?
In this unit, students consider these questions as they examine gun-violence activism by teenagers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and discuss the planned school walkouts this spring. They can then go further by learning about youth movements in history, and, finally, considering actions they might take around the issues they care about.
Please let us know how youre addressing this teachable moment in your classroom, and how we might help. You might also invite your class to post comments in our Student Opinion forum, Do You Think It Is Important for Teenagers to Participate in Political Activism?
_________
Charles Whitman opened fire on the University of Texas campus in 1966. Since then, the images of school shootings across America are almost indistinguishable.
Warm Up:
Ask students to respond in writing to the following questions, then discuss them in pairs, small groups or as a whole class:
 Can people under age 21 make a real impact on society? For example, can they be instrumental in changing laws or policies on issues they care about? How? What examples from the past or present can you think of to support your opinion? List as many as you can.
Advertisement
 What qualities, skills, circumstances or perspectives are unique to young people  whether today or in the past  and how might they help make their voices uniquely powerful?
Advertisement
_________
Watch, Listen or Read:
Demands for gun restrictions have followed one mass shooting after another, but little has changed. This time, the students who survived are leading the charge.
Depending on how much time youd like to spend, you can choose from three different options to have your students learn more about the activists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
They can watch this video, also embedded at the top of this lesson; listen to the first 10 minutes and 20 seconds of an edition of The Timess The Daily podcast, embedded above (stopping at the commercial break); or read this article from New York Magazine, War Room: The teenage strategy sessions that built an anti-gun movement out of the trauma of Parkland in one week. Or, use all three.
As they watch, listen or read, have them take notes on this handout, which asks: What do these students want? What are they doing to achieve it? What impact are these actions having? Why?
Invite them to share ideas in small groups, then, as a class, compile their lists on the board.
Finally, follow up by asking students to discuss:
 What actions seem to be most effective? Why?
 Do you think these students be able to make a lasting impact on this issue? If yes, why? If no, why not?
 What barriers might they run into? Why?
 What suggestions do you have for these student activists?
 What reactions or questions do these students activism raise for you? Why?
If you like, you can then invite your students to add their responses to the forum we have posted in our Student Opinion section: Can High School Students Make a Real Impact on the Problem of Gun Violence in the United States?
Advertisement
For example, here is one comment we received from Jordyn I. of Westfield, N.J. Do your students agree?
I believe that my generation has the power to change the world more than any group before us. Unlike the generations in decades past, we have more information available to us than ever before. Social media, arguably the most powerful tool of communication in the history of the world, is at our fingertips. With the click of a button, our words can be shared with millions. All it takes is one tweet, one post on Instagram or Facebook. And a second later, your opinion is broadcasted everywhere. The internet has empowered us to have the ability to change the world, even at the young ages that we are.
Another option? Invite students to watch this video of students responding to the Parkland movement via the PBS Student Reporting Labs.

 Discuss Student Rights in the Context of Planned School Walkouts
At least two school walk-outs around gun violence have been slated for this spring. On March 14, a month after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, students and teachers across the country are planning to leave school for 17 minutes, one minute for each person killed in the attack. Another walk-out will take place on April 20, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine massacre. (A third protest, March for Our Lives, will happen on a Saturday, March 24.)
Though some districts have threatened to suspend students, in New York City, the mayor has said he supports those who want to participate, and has even promised that the city will provide related lesson plans. In How Young Is Too Young for Protest? A National Gun-Violence Walkout Tests Schools, The Times reports that many elementary schools across the country are wrestling with the question of whether even kindergarteners should be involved.
What is your classroom, school or districts policy on walkouts? How many of your students plan to participate?
Whether you support the walkouts or not, they are, as an article at Education Week put it, an opportunity to elevate student voice and action as powerful teachable moments.
To help, you might gauge what your students know  or think they know  about their rights. Invite them to work in small groups to brainstorm answers to these questions, perhaps via a KWL chart:
 Do people under 18 have the same rights as adults? If not, how do they differ  and why?
 Do students under 18 have the same rights in school as they do out of school? If not, what examples can you give?
After students have shared their thoughts and questions, invite them to read School Walkouts in the Wake of Parkland  Protected by the First Amendment or Not?, a piece from the Newseum that offers helpful context and history:
Marches, walkouts and sit-ins are the embodiment of our core freedoms: the right to speak out, to assemble peaceably and petition our government for change. Such protests recall powerful moments in the civil rights movement, when energized groups of young people caught the nations attention and successfully pushed for social and political change.
The student voices in the Parkland movement also call to mind the circumstances around the landmark 1969 Supreme Court decision Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District, which also involved teens, schools and the freedom to protest.
Then, have students follow this overview up with another Newseum resource, Classroom Walk-Outs and School Protests: Everything you need to know whether youre a student, parent, teacher, school administrator, or lawyer or with the ACLUs page on Students Rights: Speech, Walkouts, and Other Protests. Still another resource? The new Youth in Front site, a community-created online learning resource, with advice from experienced youth activists and allies.

Challenge students to return to the original questions for which they brainstormed answers and correct or add detail to anything they now understand better. How would they summarize their answers? What questions are they left with? Where can they find answers?
As a final activity for this part of the unit, students might produce a piece for their school website or newspaper clarifying student rights and responsibilities in the context of student activism on gun violence. To do this, they might interview school or district administrators, teachers and students; consult written school policy; and learn more about their school or communitys history of related student activism.
Update, March 15:
Your students can see videos and photos of and read about the March 14 walkout in National School Walkout: Thousands Protest Against Gun Violence Across the U.S. We have also posted a companion Student Opinion question, Do You Think It Is Important for Teenagers to Participate in Political Activism?

KQEDs The Lowdown has produced a timeline called Too Young to Vote, Old Enough to Take Action: A Brief History of Powerful Youth-Led Movements. To introduce it, Matthew Green writes:
This is hardly the first time high school students have led the charge in pushing for nationwide reforms. In fact, the nascent Never Again movement follows in a long tradition of middle and high school students who, despite being too young to vote, have helped lead landmark social and political movements. Among the most recent (and often overlooked) examples include the young people on the front line of the Black Lives Matter movement, Dreamers activists fighting for immigration reform, and the group of American Indian youth who helped spark the Standing Rock movement in South Dakota last winter.
As University of Oklahoma professor Kathryn Schumaker noted in a recent Washington Post commentary, student protesters have long risked disciplinary action or worse to force the nation to have difficult conversations about the future they stand to inherit.
The Times has also taken on the topic, in a piece headlined 7 Times in History When Students Turned to Activism.
Maggie Astor writes that history is full of movements led by students  albeit usually in college, not high school. Some were successful and others brutally crushed, but even the latter still resonate. She also points out that most of these campaigns have been liberal-leaning: Though conservative college students have made their presence known, their actions have rarely coalesced into broader movements.
Invite students to study the slide show, and read the Times article. What do these movements have in common? How do they differ?
Then, invite them to choose one of featured movements and delve into it more deeply. As they do so, they might use the same chart they kept in the first part of this lesson to take notes: What did these students want? What actions did they take to get it? What impact did those actions have, and why?
To report back to the class on their findings, they might answer a version of the same questions we asked about the current gun-violence activism:
 What actions seemed to be most effective? Why? How were they unique to their time, place and circumstances?

 Can we still feel the impact of these students activism on this issue? How?
 What barriers did they run into? Why?
 What can student activists today learn from them?
Raising Questions: Different Responses to Different Kinds of Activists?

            "Young black activists have been in the streets advocating for gun reform for decades without much attention or mass appeal, but that doesn't mean they don't exist, that they work without leadership, or that their demands are unclear." #DoBetter https://t.co/s1VTWutlZA 
As the Times article summarizes it, the Black Lives Matter movement began with three women in their late 20s and early 30s: Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi. But when it exploded into national view in 2014 after the police killing of Michael Brown, 18, many of the protesters who filled the streets of Ferguson, Mo., were students.
But, as this piece in Teen Vogue argues, Young black people have been fighting to save lives through gun reform laws for years without the support and energy given to the Stoneman Douglas students. In fact, black youth, whove been passionately advocating for gun control measures, have been demonized, obfuscated, and overlooked.
Parkland students themselves have credited Black Lives Matter as a model for their own movement:

            Much of what Ive done and wanted to do was inspired by Black Lives Matter. Were protesting the exact same way and being called heroes just because the majority of us are white. America needs to do better in so many ways. https://t.co/TZp0ESCfIv 
In early March, several of the Parkland students met with students in Chicago to talk about how to combat gun violence in communities nationwide.
If your students choose this youth-led movement to research further, they might also address these questions:
 Are there differences in how Black Lives Matter student activists have been received by the media and the public compared to the Stoneman Douglas students? If so, what do they think accounts for those differences? What evidence can they find to support their point of view?
 What can, or should, be done  whether by the student activists themselves, by the media or by fellow citizens  to make sure all voices on an issue are heard?
_________
Though we have focused on gun violence in this lesson, there are, of course, many other issues young people are passionate about. What problems in our world might inspire the students you teach to start or join a movement for change?

In our lesson plan Ideas for Student Civic Action in a Time of Social Uncertainty, we outline five steps students can take together, as explained by Chicago high school teacher Elizabeth Robbins in a TEDx talk:
1. Identify issues important in their lives and community, and decide on one to address.
2. Research the chosen issue and decide how to change or improve the situation.
3. Plan an action, including determining a goal for change; identifying who or what body in the community has power to make the change; and deciding how to approach that person or those people.
4. Carry out the action through letters, talks, meetings with officials, policy proposals, and activities, depending on the specific goals of the project.
5. Reflect on the effort when it is over in order to understand their successes, challenges, and ways to continue learning in the future.
Though our lesson plan offers details for each step, below weve added a few more resources that may be helpful.
 Identify Issues 
Invite your students to write individually, then brainstorm as a group, as many answers as they can to these questions:
 What issues do you care about? Why?
 What changes do you want to see happen in your school, community, state, the country or even the world?
Students might write their answers on the board, on sticky notes or in a shared class document so that everyone can see the range of ideas. Next, invite them to group what they find into several broad categories. Finally, have students team up around related issues to decide what to do next.
Consider a Range of Actions
Not everyone is comfortable speaking on camera, or walking out of school for a cause, yet everyone can find something to do to effect change.
Advertisement
Which of the actions students identified when reading about the Parkland students or about youth-led movements in history could help them bring change on the issue they have chosen? How?
Below, a few options, each linked to a Times or Learning Network article that offers an example, ideas or more information:
Engage with lawmakers.
Use social media.
Create a petition.
Run for office.
Raise money.
Volunteer.
Engage the press.
Advocate to those in power to change rules or legislation.
Write an editorial.
Plan protests or other acts of civil disobedience.
Educate others.
Start programs that solve problems.
Take legal action.
Register to vote, encourage others to vote, and/or get involved in the push to lower the voting age to 16.
Finally, Answer Ten Questions for Participatory Politics
In After Parkland, Students Choose to Participate, our colleagues at Facing History recommend introducing students to powerful ideas for thinking about civic participation and social change, such as the political theorist Danielle Allens Youth Participatory Politics Framework. Ms. Allen suggests that when people choose to take action, they should consider the ten important questions above. How would your students answer them?
To learn more, use the Facing History lesson plan Reflection and Action for Civic Participation that links to many different readings in which students can observe the questions in action.

            As with all historic tipping points, it seems inevitable in retrospect: Of course it was the young people, the actual victims of the slaughter, who have finally begun to turn the tide against guns in this country. https://t.co/Tvy1buS2da

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSMARCH 26, 2018, 9:41 P.M. E.D.T.

NEW YORK   They have walked out, marched and demanded action across America to stop gun violence. But it's far from certain that the young people behind the "March for Our Lives" movement will be a political force at the ballot box this fall.
Republicans are skeptical. Democrats are hopeful. And outside groups that favor gun control aren't taking any chances.
Organizations aligned with Democrats on gun control are spending tens of millions of dollars to ensure that young voters' passion and enthusiasm doesn't fade before the November midterm elections, when the Republican Party's control of Congress will be put to the test.
"Other people look at those young people and think organizing them makes no sense because they don't vote," said Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge-fund magnate-turned-liberal activist who has committed at least $31 million this year to what is believed to be the largest youth vote organizing effort in American history. "We really believe in this generation."

Past voting patterns show how much work Steyer and others have ahead of them. Just 15 percent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 20 cast ballots in the last midterm election.

Still, the mobilization of young people following last month's shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school has raised the prospect of a shift that could re-shape the American political landscape this fall  and perhaps for much longer.
Student leaders from Parkland have already succeeded in keeping the gun debate from quickly fading, as is often the case after mass shootings, though that hasn't resulted in any significant congressional action. Hundreds of thousands of people, many of them in high school, participated in protest marches across the country Saturday. New waves of protests are already being planned for next month.
Their efforts are being aided by powerful groups that favor stricter gun laws. Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization backed by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, expects to spend more money shaping the 2018 midterms than any other election  and much of it on youth engagement, said chief operating officer Matt McTighe.
The organization already spent more than $1 million to help student organizers participate in last weekend's marches. They're now focused on helping high school and college students nationwide organize their own "Students Demand Action" groups, a spinoff of the organization's "Mom's Demand Action" against gun violence chapters. Everytown also helped young people establish the non-profit group that coordinated the weekend marches, while in some cases paying for nuts-and-bolts items like sound systems and stages.
"They've got the energy. They've got the passion. They don't necessarily have the resources or the policy expertise," McTighe said. "We're going to be investing heavily in these students and making sure they engage in politics in every race and every single district across the country."
Additionally, groups backed by Steyer, Bloomberg and former Rep. Gabby Giffords will launch nationwide voter drives on high school campuses in the coming weeks. The operation, according to Giffords' executive director Peter Ambler, will especially target "districts and states where new young voters can have the most impact." Giffords' group, like its allies, will also devote significant resources to sophisticated get-out-the-vote operations targeting young voters.
"They're very powerful right now," Ambler said. "I'm very excited to see what they do with that power."

Republican strategists suggest that the youth movement could prove particularly troubling for their candidates in America's suburbs, where dozens of vulnerable GOP House incumbents already face a wave of Democratic enthusiasm and skepticism from moderate Republicans dissatisfied with President Donald Trump's job performance.
It's less clear whether a surge in youth turnout would sting Republican candidates in Senate races playing out in rural states like North Dakota and West Virginia, where a fight over gun control could motivate Trump's most passionate supporters as well.

Republicans are skeptical that young voters, who typically favor Democratic candidates by large margins, will stay interested.
"Motivation is fleeting," said Republican strategist Chris Wilson.
While equally skeptical about the short-term impact, Republican pollster Frank Luntz warned his party that a mass migration of young voters to the Democratic Party could endanger GOP candidates for years to come.
"There are a lot of dark clouds ahead for Republicans," Luntz said. "The impact of the youth vote isn't immediate, but it could well have the greatest impact of all."
Young voters, with few exceptions, have struggled to maintain interest in politics over the last half century.
In 1972, when the voting age was first lowered to 18, nearly 56 percent of eligible 18- to 20-year-olds voted, according to an analysis by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. Participation has trended downward ever since, with one exception being President Barack Obama's first presidential election.
But in the first midterm election of Obama's presidency, participation rates for 18- to-20-year-old voters regressed to just 18 percent.
"This energy we're seeing right now is in March. The election is seven months away. It takes a lot to keep up this enthusiasm," said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of the Tufts center.
Advertisement
She suggested that interest groups and political campaigns could help motivate young people, as Obama did in 2008, but young voters are more likely to be influenced by people they encounter at home or school.
It's also unclear whether issues alone, even one as powerful as gun violence, can lead to lasting political change. Kawashima-Ginsberg's center studied the impact of high-profile ballot issues that might appeal to young voters  the legalization of marijuana and same-sex marriage  in past elections, finding that such social issues alone typically had little impact.
Steyer, for his part, is prepared to spend whatever it takes to ensure young voters don't get distracted. His $31 million pledge, he said, is simply "the floor" of what he's prepared to spend this year.
"What we're trying to do is organize as well as possible to make sure that they get a chance to raise their voices," he said, "but also to make sure their votes are counted on Nov. 6."

NEW YORK  Some of Wall Street's heaviest hitters are stepping into the national debate on guns as investment firms ask firearms makers what they are doing about gun violence.
The firms speak softly, but because they own trillions of dollars' worth of stock, their voices travel far. And they're now joining forces with some unusual allies, including smaller and untraditional investors. In this context, the investment fund BlackRock, which owns big stakes in three different gun makers, might end up working alongside a group of nuns.
Sister Judith Byron, the director and coordinator of the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment, says her group and BlackRock appear to have similar ideas when it comes to gun manufacturers and retailers. Following the killing of 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, funds like BlackRock started asking gun manufacturers what they are doing to reduce the risks of gun violence, and asking retailers how much they make from selling guns.
Byron says her group, a coalition of religious communities and health care systems, invested in firearms makers a decade ago and has been working on gun safety issues for years. In the last few months the coalition introduced resolutions pushing American Outdoor Brands, Sturm Ruger and retailer Dick's Sporting Goods to give reports to investors about the steps they are taking to reduce gun violence.
"We're hoping we can engage these big investors and encourage them to vote for our resolutions," she says.
Some larger investors have similar views. The biggest public pension funds in the U.S., CalPERS, recently refused to sell its investments in companies that sell assault rifles. It says that by remaining an investor, it's been able to get those companies to make positive changes.
The nuns aren't protesters, and they don't carry props or signs to disrupt board meetings, although they sometimes work alongside groups that use those tactics. Byron says some of the shareholder meetings she's attended have been downright pleasant, with investors and board members thanking her for asking questions.
Support from investment firms was crucial to the coalition's big success last year when, after decades of work, it backed a successful resolution that required oil giant Exxon Mobil to disclose the effects climate change is having on its business.
Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said companies are often reluctant to risk any sales in order to do the responsible thing. But it does sometimes happen, as when CVS stores stopped selling cigarettes in 2014. He said activists deserve most of the credit for getting the funds to speak out.
"BlackRock didn't wake up one morning and say, 'We are going to take a different approach to investing, it's the right thing to do,'" he said. "It's a reaction to the activists."
The top priority of firms like BlackRock, State Street and mutual fund company Vanguard is to make as much money as possible for their clients. But because they own so much stock, they can wield a lot of influence: They can support new directors who want to change the direction of the company and back proposals that change the way it operates.
BlackRock is a major shareholder in gun makers Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands, and Vista Outdoor Brands. About a week after the shooting in Parkland, BlackRock said it wanted to speak with the three firearms makers about their responses to the tragedy. The fund said it is looking into creating new investment funds for investors that exclude firearms makers and retailers, and if many funds and investors followed suit, that would affect the price of those stocks.
In a letter to BlackRock, American Outdoor Brands said it supports steps that will promote gun safety while protecting the rights of firearm owners. The company said it backs measures including improved background checks and improved support for people with mental illnesses, but said it's opposed to "politically motivated action" that won't improve public safety. Sturm Ruger did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In other words, there are limits to the funds' power. They aren't choosy investors and won't dump the gun makers no matter what they say. That's because their main investment strategy to invest in huge numbers of companies, including every stock listed on the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
According to Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's director of research into funds and exchange-traded funds, that means BlackRock and Vanguard don't have that much leverage compared to activist investors or hedge funds. Those investors can have more dramatic effects on individual companies because they can buy up the stock, run for seats on the board themselves, or threaten to sell the shares if they don't like the company's choices.
"They can use their wallet and sell the shares or they can pressure the companies and threaten to sell the shares if actions aren't taken," said Rosenbluth. So far, he said those investors aren't really getting involved in the debate.
Still, there have been changes: Dick's, Walmart, Kroger and L. L. Bean have all said they will no longer sell guns to shoppers under the age of 21. Rosenbluth said that has more to do with the ongoing national debate about gun safety and regulations than anything the investment firms have said, and he believes laws will ultimately have a larger effect.
But Byron, who also wants new gun laws, says she is encouraged by the response from corporate America.
"We see companies taking leadership roles in environmental and social issues, which is encouraging," said Byron, adding that as shareholders, "they're our companies. We own them."

President Trump took to Twitter on Thursday to taunt former Vice President Joe Biden. Earlier this week, Biden had suggested in a speech that he would like to fight Trump one-on-one. Trump pushed back on Twitter, saying that Biden would go down fast and hard in a fight with him.
Both Trevor Noah and Seth Meyers were amused.
Personally, I have no idea who would win this fight. I mean, Biden seems scrappy, but if 70 years of McDonalds couldnt take Trump down, I dont know what can.  TREVOR NOAH
God, can you imagine that fight? What did you say, bro? Seriously, my hearings not so good anymore  what did you say? Honey, what did he say?  SETH MEYERS
This is just what America needs: The thrilla in vanilla.  SETH MEYERS
Who are these people who think Trump is going to listen to their advice? Dont they understand, the only way to get Donald Trump to do something is to tell him hes not allowed to do it. Hes 4 years old. He doesnt need a lawyer, he needs a governess.  JIMMY KIMMEL on the resignation of John Dowd, a lawyer for Trump who resigned after concluding that the president was not listening to his advice
President Trump hosted the Greek Independence Day celebration at the White House. It was the best celebration of Greece since his kids hair.  SETH MEYERS
Mississippi yesterday appointed its first female senator  before realizing its mistake and appointing a raccoon with a gun instead.  SETH MEYERS
Heres what dangerous furniture looks like.
Trevor Noah spoke to students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., about the movement against gun violence.
The March for Our Lives in Washington and elsewhere, spearheaded by the Parkland students, is this weekend. Samantha Bee and the Full Frontal team will be at the event in Washington, streaming live on Facebook. Other late-night hosts will almost certainly have something to say about the event on Monday. The Times Late-Night Comedy Committee will be here Tuesday morning to tell you about it.

WASHINGTON  Standing before vast crowds from Washington to Los Angeles to Parkland, Fla., the speakers  nearly all of them students, some still in elementary school  delivered an anguished and defiant message: They are done hiding from gun violence, and will stop at nothing to get politicians to finally prevent it.
The students, as they seized the nations attention on Saturday with raised fists and tear-streaked faces, vowed that their grief about school shootings and their frustration with adults inaction would power a new generation of political activism.
If they continue to ignore us, to only pretend to listen, then we will take action where it counts, Delaney Tarr, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where a gunman killed 17 people last month, told tens of thousands rallying in Washington. We will take action every day in every way until they simply cannot ignore us any more.
For many of the young people, the Washington rally, called March for Our Lives, was their first act of protest and the beginning of a political awakening. But that awakening may be a rude one  lawmakers in Congress have largely disregarded their pleas for action on television and social media in the five weeks since the Parkland shooting.
That reality helped drive the Parkland survivors in Washington, as they led a crowd that filled blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and Capitol Hill. Thousands more rallied at about 800 sibling marches around the country and abroad, where students, like those in the capital, made eloquent calls for gun control and pledged to exercise their newfound political power in the midterm elections this fall.
Aerial video captured seas of people  in front of Trump International Hotel in New York; in a central square in Tokyo; along the streets of Boston; at a rally in downtown Fort Worth, Tex.; and crammed into a park less than a mile from Stoneman Douglas High.
Delivered in soaring speeches, emotional chants and hand-painted signs, the protesters messages offered angry rebukes to the National Rifle Association and politicians who have left gun laws largely intact for decades. A sign in Washington declared Graduations, not funerals! while another in New York said I should be learning, not protesting. Crowds in Chicago chanted Fear has no place in our schools as they marched.
Celebrities, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, the Hamilton star, and the pop singers Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus, performed in Washington, where politicians and adult activists were largely sidelined in favor of the fresh-faced students offering stories of fear and frustration, but also hope for change.
The most powerful, and impassioned, moments came from the surviving students of the Parkland shooting, who declared themselves angry, impatient and determined to stop the slaughter.
Today, we march, Ms. Tarr said. We fight. We roar. We prepare our signs. We raise them high. We know what we want, we know how to get it and we are not waiting any more.
An 11-year-old girl from Virginia, Naomi Wadler, captivated her audience as she declared Never again! on behalf of black women and girls who have been the victims of gun violence.
Calls like Naomis stood in stark contrast to action on Capitol Hill and at the White House in the hours before the rallies. President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that took no significant new steps on gun control: It did nothing to expand background checks, impose additional limits on assault weapons, require a higher age for rifle purchases or curb the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.
The spending legislation, which was viewed as the last opportunity this year for Congress to enact major new gun restrictions before the midterm elections in November, included only some school safety measures and modest improvements to the background check system.
Organizers at national gun control groups, who provided logistical support and public relations advice as the students planned the Washington rally, said they believed that the students would not become disillusioned by the lack of immediate action in Congress. They noted that rallies took place in 390 of the countrys 435 congressional districts.
The mass shooting generation is nearing voting age, said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national group that advocates tougher gun laws. They know the midterms are six months away, and they plan to make sure that they vote and they get others to register to vote. They are absolutely poised to turn this moment into a movement.
Gun rights organizations largely stayed silent on Saturday, following vigorous efforts since the Parkland shooting to squash any movement toward significant gun control legislation. A spokesman for the N.R.A. declined repeated requests for comment.
On the eve of the march, Colion Noir, a host on NRATV, an online video channel produced by the gun group, lashed out at the Parkland students, saying that no one would know your names if someone with a weapon had stopped the gunman at their school.
These kids ought to be marching against their own hypocritical belief structures, he said in the video, adding: The only reason weve ever heard of them is because the guns didnt come soon enough.
Small counterprotests took place in a few cities. In Salt Lake City, several hundred people gathered near a high school, some carrying signs with messages like AR-15s EMPOWER the people. Brandon McKee, who wore a pistol on his belt, brought his daughter, Kendall, 11, who held a sign that said Criminals love gun control.
I believe its their goal to unarm America, and thats why were here today, Mr. McKee said of the Washington marchers. In Boston, about 20 protesters favoring gun control confronted a small clutch of Second Amendment supporters in front of the State House. The two sides quickly got into a shouting match.
Crowds gathered in cities across the United States and around the world.
The pro-gun protests were swamped in size and enthusiasm by those marching for gun control, many of whom traveled for many hours to attend the rallies in cities across the country. Sebastian Jennings, 18, said he spent 36 hours taking a bus to Washington from western Arkansas. Tour buses lined the streets.
Security was tight in Washington, where military trucks and guards blocked almost every intersection near the rally amid a huge police presence, and in other cities where marches and rallies forced the closing of major roads.
In towns like Dahlonega, Ga., smaller rallies sought to demonstrate a desire for new gun restrictions even in rural, Republican-leaning communities where gun ownership is common and support for the Second Amendment is strong.
Were going to be the generation that takes down the gun lobby, Marisa Pyle, 20, said through a red megaphone to a group of several hundred people gathered in front of the Dahlonega Gold Museum.
Around the world, Americans living abroad gathered to honor those who have died in school shootings and to echo the call for gun control.
Protesters in Rome jammed the sidewalk across from the American Embassy, next to the upscale Via Veneto, raising their voice in chants  Hey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go, and waving signs with messages like A gun is not fun and Am I next? many made by high school students at an international school.
About 150 to 200 people in Berlin gathered in solidarity in front of the Brandenburg Gate, just steps from the American Embassy. Many carried hand-painted signs, among them: Arms should be for hugging, Bullets arent school supplies and Waffeln statt Waffen (Waffles instead of weapons).
One of the largest rallies outside Washington was at a Florida park not far from Stoneman Douglas High School. During that event, 17 students from the school silently took the stage to represent their friends who had been killed.
Anthony Montalto, the brother of Gina Rose Montalto, one of those killed, held a sign that said: My sister could not make it here today. Im here for her.
Turn this moment into a movement, Sari Kaufman, a sophomore at Stoneman Douglas, implored the sea of students, parents and teachers. She urged her classmates to vote out of office politicians who receive money from the N.R.A. They think were all talk and no action.
But the largest rally, by far, was in Washington, where stage risers and giant television monitors were set up in the shadow of the Capitol  the focus of much of the anger from students throughout the day.
One protester carried a sign that said If the opposite of pro is con, then the opposite of progress is Congress.
Most Republican and Democratic members of Congress had already left the city to return to their home districts for spring break. Mr. Trump spent Saturday afternoon in Florida, at the Trump International Golf Club, less than an hour north of Parkland. A White House spokeswoman said in a statement, We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today.
City officials had prepared for the biggest march since about a half-million women gathered on the day after Mr. Trumps inauguration, declaring a new political movement aimed at resisting the president and his policies.
On Saturday, officials with Metro, the regions subway system, said more than 207,000 rides had been taken on the system by 1 p.m., about half of the number by that time during the Womens March.
A team of crowd science researchers led by G. Keith Still of Manchester Metropolitan University in England estimated that about 180,000 people attended the rally. They examined photographs, video and satellite imagery to estimate the crowd density in different areas of the demonstration. The number is less than half of the 470,000 that Dr. Still estimated had attended the Womens March in Washington in 2017.
Even so, the streets of Washington were packed on Saturday. Teenagers climbed on each others shoulders to reach the bare limbs of trees, where they climbed higher. And each student who spoke drew a cheer that matched, and even eclipsed, the applause given to the musical performers.
Edna Chavez, 17, a high school senior from Los Angeles, said she had lost her brother to gun violence: He was in high school when he passed away. It was a day like any other day. Sunset down on South Central. You hear pops, thinking theyre fireworks.
Ricardo was his name. Can you all say it with me? she asked. The crowd said his name over and over again, as Ms. Chavez smiled through tears.
Naomi Wadler, the 11-year-old student, introduced herself with a soft hi and said she represented the black women who have been victims of gun violence.
People have said that I am too young to have these thoughts on my own, she said. People have said that I am a tool of some nameless adult. Its not true. My friends and I might still be 11, and we might still be in elementary school, but we know.
She added, And we know that we have seven short years until we, too, have the right to vote.

New this week:
PRAY ME STAY EAGER By Ellen Doré Watson. (Alice James Books, paper, $15.95.) On the evidence of this exuberant poetry collection, her fifth, Watson (who directs the Poetry Center at Smith College) has stayed eager indeed. One poem describes frogs going nutso down in that sinkhole / pond, and closes, they could care / less whether I thank or curse them / for their farty calls speaking sex. WILD IS THE WIND By Carl Phillips. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) The love poems in Phillipss 14th collection embrace the paradox of desire and stability, with his customary long lines and discursive, inquisitive voice. BULLETS INTO BELLS: POETS AND CITIZENS RESPOND TO GUN VIOLENCE Edited by Brian Clements, Alexandra Teague and Dean Rader. (Beacon Press, paper, $15.) Clements conceived of this anthology, made up of poems about gun violence and responses from affected readers, after his wife, a teacher, survived the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Contributing poets include Natasha Trethewey, Ada Limón and Ocean Vuong  as well as Clements himself, whose poem 22 concludes with the events of that day and ends, despairingly, After that, a lot of other things happened, / but it doesnt really matter what. COLLECTED POEMS By Galway Kinnell. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $35.) Kinnell, who died in 2014, was a towering figure in American poetry, publishing 10 collections over 65 years; in 1982, his Selected Poems won both a Pulitzer and a National Book Award. This is the first volume to gather all of his work in one place.
In which we ask colleagues at The Times what theyre reading now.
There would have been no The Da Vinci Code without Elaine Pagelss THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS, her calmly dazzling 1979 reading of a long-hidden trove of early Christian texts. Uncovered in the 1940s, these blockbuster documents kaleidoscopically broadened our sense of what Christianity was and is. As Pagels explains with graceful care, what has come down to us as the religions fundamental tenets  regarding the reality of Jesus resurrection, the nature of his martyrdom, the status of women, even monotheism itself  were not foregone conclusions but the victors in fierce (indeed, deadly) struggles for social and political authority. Its always a lot of chaotic battles that got us to the place we are; this is true of the canon in classical music, too, which is why its been fun, as I belatedly read Pagels, to also thumb through Nicolas Slonimskys hilarious LEXICON OF MUSICAL INVECTIVE, a compendium of all the bad reviews that great works  were talking Beethovens Ninth, etc.  got when they were new. In both books, history is shown in the messy process of forming.
 Zachary Woolfe, classical music editor

A 16-year-old girl critically injured in a shooting at a Maryland high school this week died on Thursday night after she was taken off life support.
The girl, Jaelynn Willey, was surrounded by her family when she died shortly before midnight, the St. Marys County Sheriffs Office said. She had been at the University of Maryland Prince Georges Hospital Center since Tuesday, when another student shot her in the head in a hallway at their school in Great Mills, Md.
Earlier on Thursday, her parents said that she was brain dead.
My daughter was hurt by a boy who shot her in the head and took everything from our lives, her mother, Melissa Willey, said at a news conference at the hospital as she clutched her youngest child in her arms.

Shortly before 8 a.m. on Tuesday, the police said, Austin Wyatt Rollins, 17, opened fire inside Great Mills High School with a handgun, striking Jaelynn and a 14-year-old boy. Jaelynn was shot in the head and collapsed in the hallway outside an art classroom, students said. The boy, Desmond Barnes, was shot in the thigh and was hospitalized. He has since been released.

The authorities were still trying to determine whether Jaelynn and her killer had had a relationship. The sheriff had said Wednesday that they did, but on Friday the office seemed to walk back that assertion, saying merely they were acquainted.

The shooting, which lasted about a minute, ended in a confrontation between the gunman and an armed school resource officer stationed at Great Mills High. The officer, Deputy Blaine Gaskill, responded almost immediately and fired his weapon at the gunman, who later died at a hospital. Deputy Gaskill was unharmed in the exchange.
While it was not immediately clear if the officer struck Mr. Rollins, the deputys quick response brought renewed attention to the national debate over gun control and how to prevent mass school shootings after the killing of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last month in Parkland, Fla. Some politicians, including President Trump, have advocated arming teachers and placing additional police officers in schools. Others have criticized the idea.
Survivors of the Stoneman Douglas shooting have organized the March for Our Lives, a rally to end gun violence planned for Saturday.

YouTube said this week that it would tighten restrictions on some firearm videos, its latest policy announcement since coming under scrutiny after last months mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla.
The video-streaming service, which is owned by Google, said it would ban videos that promote either the construction or sale of firearms and their accessories. The new policy, developed with expert advice over the last four months, will go into effect next month, it said.
While weve long prohibited the sale of firearms, we recently notified creators of updates we will be making around content promoting the sale or manufacture of firearms and their accessories, specifically, items like ammunition, gatling triggers, and drop-in auto sears, YouTube said in a statement.
YouTube, which described the move as part of regular changes to policy, notified users in a Monday forum post. The company had previously banned videos showing how to make firearms discharge faster, a technique used by the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas last fall.

The announcement comes days before planned student-led protests against gun violence on Saturday. It was met with frustration from gun rights advocates.

Much like Facebook, YouTube now acts as a virtual public square, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a private group representing gun makers, said in a statement. The exercise of what amounts to censorship, then, can legitimately be viewed as the stifling of commercial free speech, which has constitutional protection. Such actions also impinge on the Second Amendment.

The policy shift comes as YouTube and other technology platforms face increased scrutiny after the Parkland shooting, in which 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
Days after that massacre, a video promoting a baseless conspiracy about a shooting survivor became the top-trending video on YouTube, prompting a crackdown on such videos. YouTubes chief executive also said that the platform planned to fight misinformation by working in partnership with Wikipedia, the nonprofit user-run online encyclopedia. But Wikipedia said it  knew nothing about that plan.
Other businesses have also made changes amid growing pressure following the Parkland attack.
Dicks Sporting Goods, Walmart and Kroger all raised the age limit for firearm purchases to 21. The retail chains REI and Mountain Equipment Co-op suspended orders of some popular products because the company that owns those brands, Vista Outdoor, also manufactures assault-style rifles.
In 2016, Facebook announced a ban on private gun sales on its flagship website as well as on Instagram, the photo-sharing social network it owns. Anti-gun activists have complained that sellers still found ways around Facebooks ban.

California Today 
By                     
 ADAM NAGOURNEY and
 

 JULIE TURKEWITZ
 
MARCH 23, 2018

Good morning.
(Want to get California Today by email? Heres the sign-up.)
Delaine Eastin, a former Democratic member of the State Assembly and onetime superintendent of public education, is one of nearly 30 candidates running to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown. California Today is planning occasional Q. and A. sessions with candidates for office, and were starting with Ms. Eastin. The interview has been edited and condensed.
Q. How much do you see yourself continuing with  or not  programs and policies put in place under Governor Brown?
A. Jerry Brown has very high marks when it comes to financial responsibility and hes a strong environmental governor. Always has been. I dont give him as high marks in education. I give his father the high marks in education. His father was amazing. Having said that, Jerry Brown has a lot to be proud of, and theres a lot we should continue and I will.
Q. How big a problem is poverty and homelessness in California?
A. Its enormous. In your life have you ever seen as many homeless children? Twenty-five percent of the homeless in America are in California. We need to urgently get these children off the street  and their mothers as well.

Q. Is this something the governor has not paid enough attention to?
A. He should have declared a public emergency. Some communities are doing things. Sacramento is taking steps. Los Angeles is taking steps. There is not enough being done statewide. The governor should really be stepping up and doing things to prevent this terrible tragedy.

Q. How do you feel about the high-speed train proposed for Los Angeles to San Francisco?
A. I hope we can find a way to do it. But I cant commit to doing it if we dont find a revenue stream. It really is saying well build a big expensive thing when we cant afford to give kids health care, we cant afford to educate kids. There are things that are more important than high-speed rail. If we have to walk away, we will. Still, Im one who believes that where theres a will, theres a way.

Current Events Conversation 
By                     
THE LEARNING NETWORK

FEB. 22, 2018

This week, chiefly in response to questions about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., we heard from new schools across the country, including some in Jersey City, California and Texas, as well as from many students in Greenbrier, Ark. Those comments are still coming in, so were sorry if we missed some. We were impressed by the generally civil tone of the conversation over all, and by the thoughtful and honest responses from all points of view.
Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear just as they were originally submitted.
_________
Our most-commented-on post this week was, unsurprisingly,  What Is Your Reaction to the Deadly Shooting at a Florida High School? Students unanimously expressed sadness, disgust or horror. There was a wide range of views from students as to the root of the problem of mass shootings in schools, but most commenters mentioned stricter gun laws as a partial solution.
BEATTY from SHS Swamps comment garnered a Readers Pick:
Its obviously not right what he did and what all the other school shooters did. The government needs to actually do something instead of showing their grievance about the topic. After the Columbine Shooting every town had to have a security guard or a resources officer but as we can all see that has done absolutely nothing. The Florida high school had multiple guards at the school yet he still got in the school, pulled the fire alarm, shot multiple students/ teachers, AND pretended to be one of the students that were trying to escape. The fact that he was able to buy an AR-15 LEGALLY is not good at all. It shows how easy it is to get an AUTOMATIC weapon even with the mental troubles that he as a child and into his teenage years. The US needs to do something about this epidemic and they need to do something about it quickly.
Anna Marston from Swampscott High School in Swampscott, Mass., said she was going to march in protest:
When I received the notification from my iPhones News app that this shooting took place, my heart sank as I couldnt begin to imagine the fear rushing through the minds of the parents, teachers, and students whose lives were in jeopardy. While my school has not faced any gun violence, I do recall a time in middle school where a student brought a bullet in their backpack to school  I was petrified.
In seventh grade after the Newtown incident, I was too scared to go to school for a few days. Guns  ARs in particular  absolutely terrify me and it blows my mind how it takes this many gun-related deaths to heed attention of the country. My school has practiced lockdowns and mentioned the training of ALICE drills but we have not been trained, and this scares me because I would freeze up and not know what to do in the case of an active shooter. I do not believe there are enough school security precautions nor counseling resources in my high school.
Honestly, I dont feel safe in school anymore. My town is incredibly safe and the odds might be low of a school shooting, but this does not mean that well be free of any gun violence as this has been the 18th massive school shooting in 2018 alone. I dont feel that its a problem with my school but more a larger political/cultural/governmental problem in the United States, because schools did not face these same acts of violence in earlier years. I am hoping to attend the March For Life on March 24th in Boston Common to protest.
Jianwei Li from Philadelphia said no place was safe until stricter gun laws are in effect:
The problem with the school shooting isnt necessarily that the school isnt safe or that it has bad security. This is happening again and again and nothing is changing. How do we expect to prevent this if were the ones letting it happen? Anyone can be a victim and any school could be the next potential site for another shooting. What we need right now is change. The government needs to make stricter gun laws to prevent dangerous people getting their hands on a gun. If you look at statistics from other countries where they have stricter laws, there are less incidents happening. If a 19 year old with a mental illness can get a semiautomatic rife, how safe really is our country?
SLM from Philadelphia had some concrete suggestions:
The gun control laws in this country are horrific. No one else has this many mass shootings or as many guns. Australia hasnt had a mass shooting since 1996. Why is a nineteen-year-old allowed to have a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle? That just doesnt make sense to me. How many casualties need to happen until someone actually does something about it? No civilian needs a weapon like that. People always say that gun control laws shouldnt be written because of the second amendment. But you know what, when the second amendment was written, we didnt have these semi-automatic weapons. If you have psychosis or are prone to manic depression, you shouldnt have a gun! What if you become sad or angry, and to feel better, you pull out your guns, and start shooting innocent people? Thats not okay! Going to school should not be a thing that makes you nervous or terrified that you are going to be shot.
Dexter M from Durham N.C., said there were several issues at once:
This is an issue that is deeply rooted in American culture that does not seem to have a single solution. While the FBI has prevented many people inspired by these terrible events. There is always a black market for nearly anything. So banning certain guns will not stop a highly motivated individual, however, I am not opposed to banning certain guns such as the AR-15 or Tech-9 (or any sort of semi-automatic gun capable of firing multiple shots in a couple of seconds). Banning these guns would cease the production of them, and therefore reduce their availability. Another form of gun control that could be implemented is required fingerprint activation. Therefore only the legal owner (or whoever else they put on it) can fire a shot. This would most likely help reduce the mass shooting rates, as most of the firearms used are stolen from parents closets or friends houses. In this case, the 19-year-old legally purchased a firearm that  in my opinion  should not be legal in the first place. Preventative measures could also be taken on the mental side, as it is not JUST about the firearms used, its also about the mental health of wielders. Offering free counseling and mental help nationwide would be a great help.
Personally, I do not feel safe going to school knowing these events happen on a (near) weekly basis. While there has never been any gun-related issues at my school that I am aware of, I feel the government does little to prevent these events but give their condolences.
Andrew Derushia from Wilmington, N.C., said now was the time to act:
What happened Wednesday was horrific, and a serious sign that we need gun law reform. 18 lives were taken from this world at the hands of a murderer who should have never been able to grasp the weapons he used to cause this destruction. Along with the many who agree with this idea, there are also ignorant opposers who suggest the guns have nothing to do with the problem and it is all the persons fault. Accept these exact same people are raged when background checks and mental evaluations are mentioned as solutions.
Contrary to what these pro-gun people say, guns have allowed 18 school shootings to occur before the end of February. On average 6 children or teens are killed per day by guns in the U.S. Semi-automatic guns which were made for the sole purpose of killing humans shouldnt be allowed to be handled by everyday people. The gun used in the recent shooting, an Ar-15, can empty up to 800 rounds per minute leaving tens of people dead in seconds. If these guns of horrible mass murder were never allowed into the hands of the public these shootings could have been stopped without such large casualties, and maybe even prevented.
The time for gun reform is NOW, the time for change is NOW, the time to act is NOW. For the sake of children and adults across America SPEAK UP.
Doug ONeal from Kentucky said we shouldnt blame guns:
It is a nightmare that no one needs to ever experience, no one should ever have to go through, but I cant help to feel that the problem doesnt so much lay with gun control laws than parental control and a failure of the so called system that doesnt work for the underprivileged or a health care system that sucks. Before the late 80s stuff like this was rarely ever heard of, but once kids were allowed to play video games where there is uncontrolled violence, prayer removed from schools, and music talking about killing people who have made someone mad, thats when things started happening. The issues ahead of us is not going to be corrected by stricter regulations on gun control, guns dont kill people, people kill people, the question is why? Lawmakers and legislators should look closer at the real issues and stop trying to blame a tool instead the users and the so called systems that have allowed our children to slip through the cracks of society and become a tool for their political views. The idea of tougher laws on guns isnt the answer, fixing a broken system is a better start. When our children suffer at the hands of a drunk driver are automobiles blamed? Children are products of their environment and when legislators and lawmakers want to blame guns for the problems we face today all I can say is look a little better at the real issues and stop trying to place blame on an object that can not do anything unless it has someone to use it.
rey Hicks from New Orleans agreed:
I dont think guns are the problem here. I think that the customer should be checked out and observed closely and tested by certain individuals with no mental illness. Then it can be decided whether they can pay for it, or they have proper training and all that jazz. This is a sad subject and I wish for the best of the victims of this incident but I wish that you dont blame guns.
Landon Elizabeth from Florida said other countries dont have mass shootings:
I am 15, and I now fear for my safety at school.
The first problem is the gun laws itself, we need gun control laws in place, so no unstable 19 year old can go purchase an assault rifle. Its actually so mind blowing how money hungry congressmen are that theyd rather receive and collect money from the NRA, than do what they signed up for, which is to run and protect this country.
Asal Al Mohamed from Wolfeboro, N.H., said guns are illegal in his home country, Oman:
First of all, being an international student from Oman, we never have lock down drills or safety precautions because these mass shootings never happen in my country. Guns are illegal in Oman which means that no one owns guns and Ive also never heard of a shooting in Oman. However, studying at a boarding school in the U.S introduced me to the idea of lock down drills. My school has some safety precautions to prevent possible shootings. Just like fire drills, we have lock down drills that prepare us for this type of incident. We also have good security and doors that are only accessed by students and faculty key cards. So yes, I feel safe in my school.
b from Wilmington would like to abolish guns completely:
I am afraid. When I walked into school on Thursday I couldnt help but think of what I would do if someone started shooting up my school. Would I live or die? Would my friends survive? Would I have the courage to help injured people? What would I do. Its terrible that I and a lot of other people had thoughts like these running through our heads the mornings and weeks after these continuously occurring tragedies. Whats even worse is the innocent lives lost. People with so much to live for gone in an instant. People who would still be alive today if our government would pay attention and DO SOMETHING about it. Im not saying that I have all the answers and that my opinion is the solution to this epidemic but I know that something needs to be done.
If I had it my way I would do away with guns. I know that this is an unpopular opinion and that it is virtually impossible to get rid of all the guns in the United States but thats what I would do if I could. At the very least we should do with automatic assault weapons, which by definition are used for infantry use, and have better mental health screenings for people trying to license their guns. I hope that as a nation we have a revelation and make an effort to prevent another tragedy like Parkland from happening again by snuffing out this epidemic from the source.
Andy G from North Carolina thinks guns are analogous to some drugs:
I would like to start off by sending out prayers to the families that lost a close one in their lives, but making guns illegal wont help. Think of it this way; many drugs are illegal and people still get them, so if guns become illegal people will still find ways to get them. If I could make a solution it would be to give more in depth background checks.
Francesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., is exhausted:
There are so many things I want to say about this tragedy. There is so much grief, so much anger inside of me that inundated every other sense I felt on Wednesday. So many words I want to say to the gunman, to the high school students who were all irreversibly affected by him, to Congress. But I feel like I cant anymore. I am so exhausted. So inexplicably tired of the needless and terrifying violence that has gripped America, that weve become despicably desensitized to because it happens so often. So tired of just thoughts and prayers, and idleness, when already over a dozen school shootings have occurred since the beginning of 2018. So tired of mass shootings being chalked up to mental illness, when mental illness is an issue globally, yet the U.S. is still the only nation where this regularly happens. So tired of hearing guns dont kill people, people kill people, when we should be fixated on the fact that people are being killed in the first place. So tired of seeing that an amendment that was written over 200 years ago is being protected over the lives of children who didnt deserve this. So tired of every single victim of gun violence being overlooked, not given justice, and forgotten about because our government puts them on the back burner.
I am tired, and ashamed of this country and the people who run it. Weapons should not take priority over people any longer. Things need to change. And they need to change now.
Olivia Lain from Wrightsville Beach, N.C., wants her children to grow up in a world where gun violence is a thing of the past:
In America, mass shootings have become an epidemic. What is the appropriate response to an epidemic? Eradication. When smallpox was an issue, we did all in our power so that no one could get smallpox ever again. Vaccines werent given to a select few, they were given worldwide so that absolutely no one would suffer from it, and there hasnt been a case of smallpox since it was officially declared eradicated in 1980. Action was taken by those in power to eliminate the disease, real action, not just their thoughts and prayers. The phrase thoughts and prayers should be used in cases of unpreventable destruction, such as an earthquake, and not the destruction that could be solved by the passage of legislation by Congress, preventing such deaths. Banning all semi-automatic guns and assault rifles at the very least would prevent the mass shootings we see all-too-often today. Another phrase that gets tossed around often in the wake of a mass shooting is guns dont kill people, people do. While this is true in a sense, you could kill a lot more people at once with an AR-15 than with a knife.
Rennat Hosley from Wilmington, N.C., thinks the Second Amendment is out of date:
I have to start off by saying this was very tragic event that happened on Valentines Day, I give my prayers to the families whose loved ones passed during the shooting. The way people obtain guns need to be restricted, or harder to obtain, I know the 2nd amendment is the right to bear arms, and people take that law very seriously, but nowadays we really dont need the weapons. Also many people use the weapon for bad uses like murder, or intimidating people and thats increasing many crimes. According to the article it says the man was using an AR-15 assault rifle and according to the laws of gun control you can purchase an AR-15 when youre at the age of 18 with a license but you have to be the age of 21 to purchase a handgun. That doesnt make much sense from the fact that an AR-15 can be more deadly than a handgun. I hope someday we can fix this problem happening in America.
Manuel Garza from Los Angeles focused on the Florida students experience:
I heard that students were Snapchatting their experience during the whole thing. And that people are calling them out and saying that what they were doing was stupid. Which is very insensitive since the students didnt know what else to do. One student said that they were all calling 911 and 911 told them to stop calling.
Amber M from South Carolina relayed personal experiences:
A couple years ago there was a gun incident at my brothers school  a kid brought a gun to show off to his friends, it accidentally went off. It was chaos for awhile, people didnt know if it was an accident or not. All my family knew was that a shooting had occurred at my brothers school, everyone was so worried.
At my old school, a kid brought a gun to school this year and went running through the halls with it. He didnt shoot anyone, but he escaped campus and caused a big police chase. A lot of fear in both of those incidents when families were still figuring out what was going on. Every year we have to watch videos on what to do if a shooting occurs, and they always remind us of the genuine danger that schools can present these days. Its frightening to have to worry about friends and siblings whenever theres an incident. Especially in my state, where guns are really easy to obtain, theres a lot of worry.
Luiza Sulea from Philadelphia replied to Amber M and took issue with some schools gun policies:
Wow, that is so scary. I think that if something like this happened in my school, Id be too panicked to breathe. Even in these nonviolent gun situations, it just shows how terrible and how easy it is to sneak a weapon into school. I read something a while ago that a student wrote. She said that it was against her schools policy to wear a tube top, but the students were allowed to carry a weapon under 4 inches. I dont necessarily know if this is true, but I wouldnt doubt it with all the weapon and gun violence that has been happening recently.
Deana Perera from Bryant, Ark., suggested things schools can do:
The school shootings that periodically erupt all over the United States are terrible and my heart is filled with sorrow at the thought of so much suffering. May God please bless all those suffering from the shooting yesterday. Thankfully at my high school we have not had to suffer through any shootings recently.
I believe that tightening gun laws will only solve half the problem because I feel that schools can do more on their part in taking good security measures. Some pretty good security measures that all schools might want to consider are resource officers and student IDs. The resource officers not only intimidate any one who poses a threat from outside the school, but their presence also effectively discourages violence within the school. Threatening disciplinary action to anyone walking around without a student or administrators ID, all schools can be very careful about who they let on campus. Another step schools can take is an alert system that connects to all administrators phones so that if there is a threat to the school, all administrative personnel can be immediately notified without having to spread the information through the intercom system and also alerting the shooter. The awful shootings are heart-wrenching and devastate many lives. We need to do everything we can to help each other and keep our schools safe. These precautionary steps arent always the cheapest, but can anyone really put a price on how much peoples lives are worth?
Oliver D. from Central Texas knows what to do in the event of an active shooter, thanks to a teacher:
With the influx of school shootings this year, I feel like the schools in my area are growing less and less safe. A year or so ago, one student made a threat against the school on social media, claiming he would blow up the gym during a pep rally. The next day, after the comments had been posted, the school looked like a ghost town. Parents kept their kids home and kids skipped collectively. We did not address the issue in school, just went on after we realized the threat was empty. The panic of that day, of not knowing if some upset student would come in and target me and my friends or if we were afraid for nothing. My health science teacher, of course, was my savior when it came to situations like this, having given my class a semester of CERT (Civilian Emergency Response Training) I know what to do, where to go, and how to get my classmates out. The ONLY solution is gun control
Borad Manuch from Texas reacted to the shooting with bitter acceptance:
My reaction to the Florida shooting was actually just solidly passive and bitterly accepting. It was another school shooting, nothing shockingly knew, I thought. Youd think that at this point in time, after so many school shooting cases, that the higher ups that run our country would have already taken care of it. But as everyone can see now this isnt the case.
While I do understand that the having the right to bear arms is part of the American identity but as a collateral to having that much power in a persons hand, then there should be strict ways to obtain a gun. I dont have the slightest idea on how to effectively prevent a school shooting but that is not up to me to decide neither it is my responsibility to do so. But I do know what thing for sure and that is to obviously do something to prevent school shootings.
Ronald Zigler from Lansdale, Pa., made an analogy to a myth:
I am reminded of the story of the Minotaur, or of any ritual from ancient legend in which children were sacrificed as a form of tribute. The parallels to our contemporary world are only too clear. For far too many politicians and gun-worshippers, periodic human sacrifice is the necessary tribute that sustains their devotion. As Carl Jung, Aldous Huxley and Joseph Campbell would have each pointed out, our modern civilization is but a veneer, that is often quite transparent.
_________
Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control.
A related Student Opinion question, Can High School Students Make a Real Impact on the Problem of Gun Violence in the United States? was also popular. Below, weve posted first those responses that answer our overarching question, then those that share opinions on guns and gun control in general.

Jason Curnett from Arkansas said students already were making a difference:
Can high school students make a difference when it comes to gun control? I say they already are. Why change is happening now, after 19 years since the shooting in Columbine, why it took yet another mass shooting to become highly public, why it took seventeen more deaths, why we had to endure this many tragedies before a change is actually happening, I have no idea. However, the work that the students from Florida are doing is phenomenal. It takes a tragedy to make a change, but it shouldnt have taken this many tragedies. So, to answer the question, yes they can. In fact, they seem to be doing a better job of making a change than anyone has before.
Luke Lamporte from Wilmington, N.C., said his perspective was changing:
I am a Republican, born and raised. I am also all for the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, and I believe that the government should not have complete control over our guns. But after seeing school shootings like this over and over on the news, there comes a time when any rational person must think Hmm, maybe we should try to do something about all these shootings. What these students went through is absolutely heart breaking. I couldnt imagine what some of the kids, especially the younger kids must have felt. This is something that will change their lives forever. And if we just choose to see the whole situation as it is, a terrible thing, and if we dont look at the good that could possibly come from this, then nothing will change. This event, as horrible as it is, sparked a flame of inspiration inside the hearts of these students to go and make a difference and I believe this terrible act of violence does in fact have the potential to turn into something good.
Ever since I was old enough to really start watching the news Ive been seeing almost countless reports on shootings all around the country. Honestly, I found myself growing numb to them. But hearing all these stories of the kids doing heroic things and all the students getting together for a great cause to help save lives and protect future generations has lit a spark in me too. I intend to help these students in any way possible to accomplish their goal of having stricter regulations on guns.
Jordyn I from Westfield, N.J., said this generation had the power to change the world:
I believe that my generation has the power to change the world more than any group before us. Unlike the generations in decades past, we have more information available to us than ever before. Social media, arguably the most powerful tool of communication in the history of the world, is at our fingertips. With the click of a button, our words can be shared with millions. All it takes is one tweet, one post on Instagram or Facebook. And a second later, your opinion is broadcasted everywhere. The internet has empowered us to have the ability to change the world, even at the young ages that we are.
Ryan French from Wilmington, N.C., said school walkouts were showing people that change needs to happen, and happen fast:
I do think that there is a way for students to make the government make changes to gun laws. With the school walkouts that are currently happening along with the Moms Demand Action group creating a whole nother separate group, student focused advocacy group, something needs to be done and will be done after more people start to join in on these things. These kids were born into a world where they have to practice lockdown drills and even fathom the thought that a school shooting could happen at their own school.The people affected in this school shooting are speaking out, whether or not they are doing it in public or behind locked doors they are talking about this. Luckily with the power of the internet the students made videos and posted them online where we could see them and see how they really feel about the gun laws. In one of the videos a parent is talking about their child and how she was shot at school and he then says, dont tell me theres no such thing as gun violence. The video then cuts to people chanting, no more guns, no more guns. Now I dont completely agree with the crowd on this but I do think there should be a change to gun laws and that change and the law needs to happen fast.
Emiko Andrews from Wilmington, N.C., said the tragedy had caused students to rise up:
I believe that from the ashes of this tragedy, we are seeing high schoolers gain a new voice. From the combination of the age of the victims, to the devastation that occurred on the 14th, to the frequency of mass shootings, many of us are yearning to make change in any way we can, because we see ourselves in the victims. By protesting and walking out of school, and by keeping pressure on representatives and the NRA, we will make our voices heard. Will this effect change? I hope so. I dont want to keep worrying about being gunned down in my own school, or seeing my classmates die. Emma González is just one powerful voice being heard today, but it will take all of our efforts if we hope to see an end to mass shootings.
McKenzie Ingram from Wilmington, N.C., said students should use their voices:
After the mass shooting in Florida, many people from my school took to social media to rant about how they hated that this had to happen and how they hated that no action was being taken to prevent it in the future. Im angry too, Im angry that this tragedy is something that we have to fight for in order to prevent. In the article, A Mass Shooting Generation Cries Out for Change, when Delaney Tarr stated that she, cannot remember a time when she did not know about school shootings, I really related to her. I remember having lock down drills when I was in early elementary school. No one ever said it but I know that everyone was thinking, we are doing this for practice if someone ever decides to shoot up our school. School shootings have become so frequent that Ive even had multiple nightmares about school shootings. Ive had around 3 nightmares in which someone brings a gun into my school and starts murdering everyone in sight. Students should not be having dreams about being shot in their schools! Schools should be a safe place for everyone, schools should be a place where students can learn and grow along with their peers. Not bleed and cry out for help. I think that people everywhere should use their voices and call for action. Honestly, it shouldnt take this much effort for change but I think that if we all stand up for what is right and fight for action to be taken, we can and will end the fears of many people living in America: mass shootings.
Monalene Delo from Wilmington, N.C., said a students focus should be on getting an education:
In a generation where we have grown up hearing about school shootings as a regular occurrence, something needs to be done. It is an absolute tragedy to think of the lives that have been lost as a result of our current gun control legislation. Our generation has become so used to the idea that this can occur. We as students have a job and that is to get an education to make something of ourselves, but when we feel that it is no longer safe to go to school, then what? We need to make a change, in the article the author references a teacher saying people say its too early to talk about it but when is it the right time? It seems to me that every time a school shooting occurs we talk about gun control, but when will we actually take action. One recent movement Never again has been started by the students in Floridas most recent shooting to advocate for more gun control. We are the generation of change. Previous generations will never understand the fear that goes through our minds. It could have been my school, my friends. Enough is enough. We as students should not have to worry for our safety at school. Our main focus should be getting an education. Students shouldnt have access to guns. We need to speak up, not be afraid to talk to our teachers, counselor, and school resource officers. If we hear of anyone that could be a threat to our safety. We need to think about how this affects the lives of our students and protect them to the best of our abilities.
Colby Linn from Arkansas said background checks were a good idea:
By a Liberals logic on gun control, the best way to solve drunk driving would be the take cars away from sober people. This is what they are trying to do with firearms. There are millions of law abiding gun owners across America who use firearms as personal defense weapons, for hunting, or just for collecting. Illegal or not, if someone, like Nicholas Cruz, is crazy enough to commit murder on that scale, they will get their hands on a gun one way or the other. There are many alternatives to a ban on firearms, such as increased screenings and background checks, which I am fully behind. No mentally unstable person should be able to legally purchase a gun. Another thing is arming and training teachers. If the teachers in Florida were armed and trained, then the death count could have been much lower. Again, a direct ban on firearms will do nothing but harm, and as a U.S citizen it is an explicit infringement on the second amendment.
Addison Duncan from Greenbrier, Ark., said some restraint is needed:
Most of my family are strong Republicans. I grew up in a Republican house. I am also a firm believer in the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms and was adopted on December 15, 1791, as part of the first ten amendments contained in the Bill of Rights. I mourn for the lives lost in the Florida shooting, but I believe that we need to take some sort of precaution. My father has his concealed carry license. The ONLY reason he carries a handgun EVERYWHERE is for the protection of my family. If someone comes and tries to shoot MY family, he can protect all of us because of his concealed carry license.
My parents worry every day for my sister and I to go to school because it could happen to anyone. In the small town of Greenbrier, Arkansas, NO one would EVER imagine a mass shooting here. Our parents NEVER had it this bad when they were in high school. Our perspective on this is VERY different than the older generation. Some people do not realize how uncomfortable it is to go to a public school now. My mother has constantly told me, Addison, when I was in school, it was NEVER like this... Overall, we need to have some sort of restraint, but not so harsh that we cannot have guns at all. I hope that being educated on this topic can have some sort of impact on our society today.
David B from Arkansas said he had always feared the damage guns can cause:
All of my life, Ive grown up around guns, yet Ive always had a fear of the damage that they can cause. When I was 10, I shot a gun for the first time; a .22 caliber long-rifle, and I loved it. I know that Ive always been a good shot, and it was great to one-up my older brother with my accuracy. Guns are practical; they are tools that we use to hunt and that we use in War. As I was always told as a child, guns are not toys.
I believe that guns are not the problem in our world, but instead the fingers that pull the triggers that are problematic. A gun cannot shoot itself, but instead a mechanism is pulled back to strike a pin and thus fire a bullet. A human finger causes the gun to fire; a human mind causes the human finger to move. The mental state of a human determines whether or not innocent lives will be lost; not a gun. Say that a shooter were to come into a classroom, and open fire on students. What would students do? They would be completely defenseless against the bullets. One way to solve this is allowing teachers to conceal-carry guns to school. Even if the teacher is shot down in attempting to defend the classroom, a brave student would likely grab the teachers gun and defend the classroom by his or her self. If the government allows teachers to conceal carry a weapon, there should be certain rules set into place, such as a carrying teachers anonymity. Overall, school shootings are a problem that is growing. The government should restrict people, not guns
Bailey Stovall from Greenbrier, Ark., said the issue needed to be addressed:
While most of us can not even vote yet, we certainly all share one thing. We have a voice. A voice that we can project and allow many to hear in hopes someone will listen and actually address this issue instead of sweeping it under the rug. As said in the article, situations like this dont need to be approached so early, but we are far too late. This needed to be approached much before, and not just talked about for maybe half a month and dropped when something new comes to the news. No, this is an issue that needs to be addressed much more often, and high school students, the ones that have participated in the lock down drills for so long, can help raise awareness to it.
Tira Frazier from Arkansas said we needed gun control despite the Second Amendment:
The Second Amendment is our right to bear arms, which allows us to have guns. Freedom or not, I believe we need gun control. We do not need AR-15s lying around. Guns less likely to do damage should still be around, thats all. This is a mental health issue just as much as it is a gun or person issue. We need to be aware that this is how it has to be: it takes 17 people to die for this to be brought up again for what to happen: nothing? This is not Liberal V. Conservative. This is a battle against unnecessary killings that take the lives of those that are precious to us. As a high school student, we can use our voice all we want and hope we get justice. Mention our peers that are dying because of gun violence, and maybe well get results.
Classic Smith from Greenbrier, Ark., said to take guns away from mentally unbalanced people:
People will say that its not the guns, but the people. That is just stupid. If the people that have the guns are mentally unsound then we need to take the guns away from them. Some people will say that outlawing guns will only keep it away from the average person and only criminals will have them. However, people who have remote access to them; black market dont do crimes like this, they assassinate people and dont get caught. Also nearly every gun that is on the black market was purchased legally and is then sold illegally.
Presley Cullum from Arkansas said we needed stricter requirements to buy a gun:
I believe that our country should take action to stop these school shootings. We have already had more mass shootings in 2018 than most countries have ever had! I dont agree in banning guns completely but I do think we should definitely have some stricter laws on acquiring them. People need to go through a longer process and have to meet stricter requirements to buy a gun. Although this wont keep all harmful people from getting guns, it will be a whole lot harder and possibly decrease the number of shootings. I most definitely think we shouldnt just sit back and let these terrible shootings keep happening. A change needs to be made.

Our Picture Prompt "Black Panther" brought in comments from Southern California to Rhode Island.
Advertisement
Beatriz Mallory from Southern California was excited for the movie, even though not a Black Panther fan:
I will be attending tonights opening at a 3D theater. I am not a Black Panther or Marvel fan, preferring drama and science fiction. My reason to attend is to participate in the excitement of the birth of a new cultural touchstone for African Americans.... As a fashion enthusiast, I am also excited at seeing how those of us who will dress up will interpret the esprit of everyday Wakandans.
Nyah Price from Providence, R.I., thinks the movie will change peoples views on black actors:
I cant wait to see Black Panther, Im practically counting down the hours till I get to see it. I am a black, female, superhero nerd and I can say that Black Panther is a Marvel hero that many nerds have been waiting to see as a live action movie. Growing up he was a character that I looked up to because he looked like me, he had dark skin, and I also looked up to his wife (Storm from the X-Men who I hope they have to meet TChalla in the upcoming movies). Black Panther represents something that resonates with people, he is a strong, powerful, confident black man that rules a country with a tender heart. Now this generation can see what I, a sixteen-year-old girl, and the generation before me got to love and enjoy. The cast is made up of beautiful actors that get to show us their representation of a story that I grew up hearing. This movie is going to change peoples views on what black actors, and superheroes, are made of.
Janelly Polanco from Rhode Island said the movie catered to all ages and all people:
Watching Black Panther has been my weekend plans since its creation was announced. This movie is not only in the superhero genre, aka the best kind of movie, but it features an all African American cast. With such lack of African American actors in big, successful movies, the wait for this movie has been a long one. Watching this movie will allow people EVERYWHERE so see black excellence and success. The setting of the movie even portrays the theme of black excellence and success. In society today, with so much hatred and rare unifying instances, a movie that caters to all ages and all people is much needed. This movie has been unifying for POC I know. Even people who know absolutely nothing about the background and creation of the movie are excited to watch it.
Brandon Navarrete from Wilmington, N.C., thinks the movie will unite African-Americans:
I am totally going to watch the Black Panther, with my family and friends. I believe this movie will be a huge hit for Marvel and will also bring in many fans on opening weekend. I have seen the previews for this and it looks beyond good, it seems action packed, exciting and it will have a good story line leading into Marvels Avengers: Infinity War. Apart from this, Kendrick Lamar co-produced a genuine soundtrack that sounds amazing, it adds extra excitement to the movie in my opinion.This movie alongside others from MNarvel such as Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok, are connected to Marvels biggest movie coming in May. Apart from the entertainment aspect of this movie, there are also cultural and political sides to it, which is why I think its gathering so much interest among fans and critics. According to the article there hasnt been as much hype to African-American audiences since Spike Lees Malcolm X in 1992. A huge key factor is that the cast is mostly African American apart from Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis. I can say I agree with the statement that Mr. Grey stated saying that this film should be understood in a political context in which both the legal gains of the civil rights movement and the interracial optimism of Obama era have been undermined. This movie will bring people together and unite African-Americans, the concept of this whole project is truly amazing. Its going to be a grand expression of cultural pride for the African-American population
Tyler Rouse from Wilmington N.C., said the movie offered superhero equality:
Heck yeah, Im gonna see Black Panther! It looks like a great movie especially because it has already had so much success. Its great to finally have a superhero movie with a black cast. This is probably a big reason why it has so much interest. Many black children and little girls only have white male superheros to look up to. Its great to finally have a black superhero that isnt a sidekick. Also, Hollywood is starting to have more female superheroes such as Wonder Woman, the Scarlet Witch, and the Black Widow. I love how more women and people of color are getting better opportunities in the movie industry. Its a huge advancement in equality with jobs. Especially the movie business. I am a white male that grew up loving Captain America. It would be sad to grow up as a black child or little girl without a superhero to identify with. I was Captain America for Halloween for three years in a row. Its time for little girls and children of color to have a chance to be a superhero for Halloween.
Ryan French from Wilmington, N.C., bought tickets for opening night, and said the soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar was fantastic:
I cannot wait to see Black Panther, I actually just bought my tickets for opening night. This film has been getting hype ever since they announced it back in October of 2014, and it deserves every second of it! Chadwick Bosemans performance as Black Panther in Captain America Civil War was phenomenal and was the highlight of the movie to me. Now two years later hes getting his own film and I am so excited. The whole cast is primarily African-American excluding Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman but the whole cast is super stars. They have Michael B. Jordan as the main villain (Erik Killmonger), Luptia Nyongo (Star Wars the Force Awakens), Forest Whitaker (Rogue One), Daniel Kaluuya (Get out) just to name a few. This film is shaping up to be one of Marvels (yet again) grand slams. The movie is a superhero fans dream of a Black Panther movie, and it could really intrigue common movie goers too. The soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar is fantastic and just another reason to go and see the movie. Finally we have the reason people are probably most excited for Black Panther, it is the last Marvel movie before Avengers Infinity War and everyone is excited to see how this leads into Marvels biggest movie ever.

Our Student Opinion prompt Do You Think Youve Already Forged Your Lifelong Taste in Music? elicited a range of responses  and lots of recommendations for great music.
Jared Duarte Massachusetts said hip-hop had been a lifelong love:
My favorite genre of music is Hip Hop, Ive been really into it ever since eighth grade but Ive actually been listening to it all my life. Examples of artists: Future, Drake, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Eminem, Ed Sheeran, NF, Lil Uzi Vert. Im more into the rapping side of hip hop rather than the actual singing, so i guess thats where the Old School Rap comes into play. I used to listen to only rock songs with my Mom, Dad and Brother such as songs by A.C.D.C., Doors Down, and The Beatles but the music started to leave my mind while listening to the radio with friends because when they grew up they were listening to hip hop or both hip hop and rap. Either way my generation grew up with hip hop being more popular then most other genres. Many of my family members dont listen to hip hop but my cousins do and as a kid I would spend a lot of time with them at my grandparents and we would I guess connect to what the artists were singing or rapping about. So yes I believe I have forged my lifelong taste in music and that taste is hip hop.
Jimbus Supreme from Cool Person Avenue thinks the information is unsurprising:
1. Nothing in the article, despite the fact that the information was new to me, particularly surprised me. It makes sense that a persons taste in music solidifies during a time which their brain is finishing development; ages 11 - 16. 2. Ive never had a favorite song, but one artist I was introduced to when I was around 14 was Mac Demarco, whom I still thoroughly enjoy listening to at 17. 3. The reason early teen years are significant for forging a persons music taste is because during the early teen years, a persons brain is beginning the final stage of development. At this time, a person is more open to ideas and music. Once a persons brain is effectively developed fully, though, they are less open to new ideas and in conjunction, new music. 4. Talking to my parents and other adults around their age (50s), I have noticed that they generally enjoy the same musical artists; the Beatles, ELO, Queen, etc. Generally, these bands were popular during a 50 year olds teenage years, so it does support the evidence. 5. Mainstream music is repeated garbage, so the challenge is actually listening to it as a parent. Most mainstream billboard hits use the exact same elements, and act as money generation machines, not music. Musical complexity is low, tracks are compressed to hell, and all of them use almost identical melodies. Often, listening to this type of music is unengaging for parents who grew up listening to much more varied, complex, and creative music.
Kate Silver from Wilmington N.C., said her taste in music was ever-changing:
My music taste is constantly changing. If you asked me a year ago what my favorite song was, I can guarantee that my answer is different today. Every few months, I have to erase my Spotify playlist and start from scratch because I get sick and tired of the songs on it. Just three months ago, I was obsessed with The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and three months before that, I would only listen to mid-2000s rock. Assuming this trend continues, I cant imagine myself liking the same music I like now in 20 years. The music industry is perpetually evolving. Artists are always striving to find new ways to make their songs stand out and keep their audiences coming back for more. Who knows, maybe my favorite song will be one in an entirely different dimension that has yet to be discovered. 20 years is a long time from now.I will admit that Ill blast Taylor Swifts You Belong With Me when it comes on the radio and bask in the joy of still knowing all the words. Like the men in their 30s who love Creep, I will always have a special place for the songs that remind me of my childhood in my heart, but I look forward to discovering new songs and further developing my musical taste.
McKenzie Ingram from Wilmington, N.C., thought the age range would be older:
In this article, I really did not expect that the age where we usually find our lifelong taste in music would be 13 or 14 years old. I expected the age range to be around 20-27. Personally when I was around 13 or 14 I had quite a broad range of music but its nothing compared to the wide range of music that I listen to today. I mainly listened to emo bands such as, Good Charlotte, My Chemical Romance, Twenty One Pilots and A Rocket to the Moon. I think that the early teen years are significant for forging a lifelong taste in music because in these early years we are starting to truly realize who we are and who we want to be. The music that we listen to in this time is significant because we are in the midst of discovering what we want to do in life and how we want to do it, and the music follows us along the journey and reminds us of who we are. I feel that today, older generations struggle with the amount of swear words that are used in most songs today. Growing up in past generations, swearing was considered sinful and impolite. So now when older generations hear these words on the radio, they are typically astounded and wonder why these artists have to use such foul language to share the message of their song (or at least thats what my mom does).
Parker Maner from Wilmington N.C., said the research was flawed:
In my opinion I dont think the music I listen to today will be the same that I chose to enjoy as an adult, mostly because there will always be a new rap artist/album with a better flow than the one from a couple weeks ago. Now that seems like a pretty rude answer until you realize the flaw in the article... The title asks about your taste and I agree with. But the article shares research that for men that are now 38 rate Creep by Radiohead as the 164th on the charts, it then shares the song came out when they were 14, and it wasnt as popular for men either 10 years older or younger. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz comes to the conclusion that when the men are 14 the songs they like then shape the songs they listen to for the rest of their life. I think this is wrong and if it is correct it needs a different, wider data set. The research tells you that the men still like the song, not that they listen to similar songs in the genre. I believe a similar explanation to explain the data is that men in women are in middle school, I mean junior high while they are 13 and 14, it has been shown that these are a challenging times in life. Songs that got them though that bring back great memories and thats why they are popular for these men. I think other songs in the genre from when they are the age of 13 or 14 need to be compared to songs that are more recent that share the genre. Therefore I dont agree with the article when the title is different from the research.
Emilia Cordon Wilmington, N.C., was exposed to classical music through ballet classes:
Ive had trouble really finding my musical taste recently and was surprised after hearing that my preferences have probably been set already. From a young age my primary exposure to music has been through ballet and my parents. In ballet we listen to classical nonstop and Ive grown to really appreciate it but it never particularly struck me. What really struck me at a young age was those long car trips with my dad listening to Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Police, and The Doors. Just nonstop jamming out to Bohemian Rhapsody, Black Dog, Roxanne, and Break on Through ingrained some of the best songs in the sweetest part of my memories. But I never truly found my taste until recently when I whipped out some classic Metallica and Megadeth from my dads collection and was swept off my feet. I felt like I knew myself, and I know that I will never stop loving metal. I dont know why the early teens are so instrumental to musical taste, but know that for me Ive always really liked the same music, just couldnt really pin in down. Just play me some classic rock and Ill be good.

As we noted last week, our Student Opinion question, Is Student Debt Worth It?, was suggested by a teenage reader. While nearly all students agreed that going to college was worth taking out loans to pay for it, they had different ideas about how much and for which kind of schools.
Aubrey Ella Hyldahl from Wilmington, N.C., thinks all students should consider cost when making decisions about college:
College is a unique experience, and with that comes unique needs. I am a sophomore and have recently started looking and touring colleges to get a feel for what I want in a school and learn more about what I need to do to get there. Over the summer, I looked at Davidson College, a small, private, liberal arts college. I completely fell in love with the school and everything it had to offer. It seemed like the perfect place for me, except for the hefty price tag that comes with it.
Around the same time, I toured UNC-Chapel Hill. Unlike Davidson, it is a huge school, which is something Im not sure I want. However, the quality of education I would receive would be excellent at this state school that is tens of thousands of dollars cheaper.
Initially after these two visits, Davidson was my favorite followed closely by UNC. I thought that I could handle the immense debt that would come with it, because I was inclined to follow my heart. However, after thinking about it more, UNC soon started to encroach on Davidsons #1 spot. The reason for this is simple; I dont want to lock myself into a major that is more lucrative than something I love to do, just to pay off my loans for a school that offers a similar education to many cheaper public schools.
This is not to say I wont apply to Davidson, but cost and debt should 100% be factored into the decision of which college to go to, especially if you cant see yourself in a highly lucrative career.
Lauren Kroell from Mamaroneck, N.Y., is considering going abroad to avoid the high tuitions in the United States:
As a current high school senior applying to college, I am well aware of the fact that depending on the college I may attend, paying off debts in the future is a likely outcome. I feel that now more than ever, at least from what Ive personally observed, both parents and children are much more hands-on with the process, consistently weighing the pros and the cons. My family has taken the question of finances more seriously than any other topic regarding the admissions process, and it will be a driving factor for the school I choose. Especially because my family and I didnt grow up entirely in the United States  I was born in Australia, and have since lived in Singapore and Great Britain  until recently, we werent aware that we may have to pay a quarter of a million dollars for a bachelors degree (which both my mother and I find somewhat ridiculous in the first place), nor did my parents know they would have to save up from my birth in order for me to attend certain institutions in the U.S. that may potentially cost more. Right now, Im looking at colleges in Canada partially because my Canadian citizenship makes the costs much less expensive. I have kept in mind throughout this process that realistically, wherever I may end up  even if it isnt my dream school  not only is it going to be a fantastic institution where I will get an exemplary education, but Im also going to find a way to make it my home for the next four years, and a place I will truly enjoy and love.
Kimberly Fetherston from New Jersey is taking into account how much graduate school will contribute to her student debt:
As a prospective law student and someone who is applying to highly competitive colleges, Im still unsure. On one hand, I see debt at a more prestigious institution as an in to better jobs as more prestigious institutions carry more weight in job hunting for recent graduates. On the other hand, for those intending to pursue a post-secondary degree I think its better to go somewhere you will have less debt to pay off as grad school, medical school or law school are even more expensive and its better to save money in undergrad.
Noah Q. Berg from Southwest-Central Wilmington, N.C., suggests considering special programs at state schools for a more affordable elite education:
I think student debt is very much worth it. Without a college degree, it can be very hard to find a good paying job that does not require backbreaking labor. That being said, it is essential for students to factor in costs in their college choice. An honors college at a state school can provide as good an education as a highly ranked liberal arts college, even though the public university costs considerably less.
Myrca A. from Rhode Island already knows that money will factor into her college choices:
Student loans are a frightening thing to think about for most students, including myself. Based on this authors experience, I feel intimidated by the system because they basically crush you with all the interest rates and such. In all honesty, it has always been my dream to attend a prestigious college. A dream that seems unattainable because of the schools cost nowadays. I come from a working-class family so paying off such high debts would prove a challenge. In order to relieve the strain that debts may place on my family, I would choose a school based on its affordability. After all, the success of a student does not necessarily depend on the school they attend. Ambition is what determines success, in my opinion. Ultimately I would like to choose my career based on my interest but a high-paying job will definitely be appealing to me because I will need to pay all my loans. Yes, student debt is a problem in the United States but apparently, it is merely a consequence of acquiring an education.
Brandon Brodwater from Wilmington, N.C., says an honest conversation around finances can help students make smart decisions:
Both of my parents came from extremely low income households. Money was always tight, so they were both completely on their own as far as paying for college. Even a small state school or community college was expensive. Both of them were in the first generation of their families that achieved a higher education, and had zero knowledge or assistance in process and payment. The only thing that they both had was drive. Today, they are both Ivy League graduates with no debt between them. Through hard work and focus, they were able to receive an education and pay off their loans. I have complete respect for them.
Now that my bias is out of the way, I believe that student debts are worth every penny. A college education opens an unlimited amount of doors for the future, and with hard work and dedication, can pay for itself. Now, that being said, I also believe that many students are misinformed about what going to college entails. As Michael Arceneaux said, after taking out thousands of dollars in loans, no one mentions just how expensive and soul-crushing the debt will be. This is where a better pre-college education is necessary. I believe that it is important to be realistic about college with high school students, as opposed to only discussing its benefits. Teenagers need to be informed of the debt they will most likely accrue, and helped to plan school choices accordingly. If we emphasize smart financial decisions, people like Michael will have better debt situations.
 Sadie Gaffin from Providence, R.I., believes the government should do something about student debt:
I have always known that going to college would be expensive, but this article really reinforced everything that every adult has ever told me about the cost. When I was younger, I really wanted to go to NYU and become a pediatrician, however I recently came to the realization that NYU is one of the most expensive colleges in the United States, so I have taken it off my list. I also still want to be a doctor, but my mind is not as set on being a pediatrician as it once was. That being said, I do not have a specific dream school because there are so many schools that have programs that will aid me in becoming the doctor I want to be, so I do not need to be narrow-minded about a school just because it is one that everyone knows the name of. The school I go to will be a good school and will not put me in too much debt because I do not want to owe the bank for the rest of my money. I might take out some loans but as little as possible. I do believe student debt is a problem in the United States and it has gotten increasingly higher over the past few years. I do not want to take part in it and I hope that the government gets a grip on it. There are quite a few countries around the world where they offer their citizens free, or close to free college. Education is extremely important no matter where one lives, so I hope the United States can realize this and make it more affordable so that all students can have access.
And Anna Cross from Wilmington, N.C., summed up a lot of students anxiety with this thoughtful and humorous comment:
I have no idea what to do about my future student loans. In high school, its drilled into you that a fancy college and a high degree is your ticket to a happy, successful life. Just rack up the debt, kids, youll pay it off with your neurosurgeons salary. But what they dont tell us is that most student loan providers give you only six months after you graduate to get a job and start paying your dues, and its awfully hard to set up your life and start making bank in about 26 weeks. This means that hopeful young adults in lower to average income families are stuck in a pit of debt they cant climb out of, weighed down by paying off loans when its time to start saving money for their own lives. Here comes the stories of living off of ramen and sleeping in your parents basement; students dont have the cash to pay their credit card bills, pay rent, or properly feed themselves. And according to recent statistics, the costs of tuition are only going up.
My class and I will be graduating in 2020, the election year. I suppose my only hope now rests upon Oprah for a change in the education system. Perhaps Ill wait a year before going to college, just until the legislation passes through.

Sports fans chimed in with their favorite moments of the 2018 Winter Olympics so far.
Alexis Lariviere from Hoggard High School was inspired by the youngest gold medal winners:
The Olympics is an anticipated event that so many people enjoy to watch, me being one of them. My family and I enjoy watching the Winter and the Summer Olympics together. Most of the time the Olympics dont impact me much, but this year the games have actually been very inspiring to young athletes all around the world.
So many young kids have taken home medals this year in the Winter Olympics. It is very inspiring knowing that someone still in high school (or just out of high school) has the potential to win something as big as the Olympics. This shows that no matter how young you are, if you really try for something it will happen. This statement relates to the article about Mikaela Shiffrin because when she first competed in the Olympic Games, she went home in 5th place. Mikaela wasnt happy with her score so she kept practicing until she came back to the Olympic Games and won first place. Just a little hard work and determination changed her life.
And Josh Failla from Wilmington, N.C., was especially impressed by Red Gerard:
The Olympics, either winter or summer, is my favorite sporting event. The only problem that I have with it is that we have to wait every 2 years to be able to watch the incredible athletes from around the world perform on the highest level. The competition is not the only thing that I love about the Olympics. I love how it is the perfect stage for all countries to put away their differences and to come together to celebrate. I also learn about sports that I have never heard of, and every year I learn something new. I never realized how tough and dangerous a sport like skeleton is. It may just look like they are not doing anything, but it takes tremendous control to keep the sled on the track.
The most mesmerizing moment for me in this years Olympics is Red Gerard, the 17 year old US snowboarder that won gold in the slopestyle event. He is the youngest male Olympic snowboarding champion ever. It is hard to imagine how a kid only a year older than me is able to win the gold on the worlds biggest stage. He is half the age of some of his teammates, and it gives me motivation in my life that just because you are young doesnt mean that you cant make a difference. I cant wait to see what else the Olympics has in store.
But Luke Lamporte from Wilmington, N.C., was motivated by watching veteran athletes:
My favorite moment of the Winter Olympics this year was seeing Shaun White make his return to snowboarding and take home the gold. Ive always been a huge Shaun White fan and used to love watching him pull off near impossible tricks on the halfpipe and take home gold after gold after gold at such a young age. Now seeing him come back and do it at a much older age just shows the true talent that this man has. Im inspired by his drive to get better and his passion for the sport and one day hope to have the same for whatever I do in my life.
Several students found joy in the way the Olympics have brought together a seemingly divided world. Abby Tank from Wilmington, N.C., said it best:
I absolutely love the Olympics  both winter and summer. I always look forward to cheering on Team USA, and this year, its been great to see younger athletes dominate at the Winter Olympics such as Red Gerard and Chloe Kim. You can find me sitting on my couch, squeezing the life out of a pillow when Team USA is competing in any event. Throughout the day, Im constantly checking for updates on the Olympics, whether its the current medal count, results, etc. But whats even better to see this year than Team USA is South Korea and North Korea united under one flag. Its amazing to see what effect sports has on the world. The Olympics are respected and revered around the world, and this year have caused the seclusive North Korea to join with its southern counterpart. This Korean team represents peace, and I find myself rooting for their team just as much as Team USA. I appreciate how far theyve gone to being a unified team, especially by making a joint womens hockey team. Even though they havent won a single game this Olympics, the fact that theyre playing together is the best win of all. We can only hope that this unity and peace that are being experienced in the games will translate into a much greater picture in the future.

Students gave insightful responses to our Student Opinion question: Do You Think Porn Influences the Way Teenagers Think About Sex?
Luke  from Wilmington, N.C., thinks it does in many ways:
I, as a teenager, definitely believe that pornography has and will continue to corrupt the impressionable minds of us teenagers. I mean think about it, porn is basically everywhere now. All it takes is one click to find it on your phone. There are entire magazines dedicated to it. Movies all about it. Music that essentially talks about it. Its almost like there is no escaping it. Porn has consumed our world one way or another whether we like it or not. Porn affects the way people think even without them knowing it. The porn industry makes women look like toys and discourages their pride. I believe sex is a sacred thing created for humans to reproduce and should not be put out on the internet for the entire world to see. It also changes the way men see sex. Young kids have access to porn and if they continually watch it then when it comes time for them to have sex they will think Wow this isnt like the videos at all, maybe Ill just go home and use my hand thats a lot better. It also corrupts the way that men view women. After watching too much porn, a man starts to find women attractive based on what their body looks like, completely ignoring her personality. I believe porn is degrading to not only women but men too. It gives young kids a false sense of what a man should look like if he wants girls to find him attractive. This could lead to a feeling of depression because maybe the boy doesnt fit the perfect man mold. This should not be acceptable under any circumstances.
Denislav from Wilmington, N.C., believes pornography has taken the place of sex education:
First, to comment on the elephant in the room, it is clearly obvious that pornography has a huge impact on society  with virtually almost all adults and teenagers being exposed to it at some point in their lives. Porn often times takes the place of traditional standardized sexual education, which frankly, is quite a flop in todays system. Modern day sex-ed classes teach more about abstinence and the variety of STDs accompanied by sex than focusing on how to use proper protection to avoid any diseases or dangers when engaging in sexual intercourse. This kind of education does not help students to actually learn how to keep themselves safe and not do anything stupid  its just a mere warning telling people to not do it whilst giving no details on safety.
Furthermore, regarding the impact that pornography has on masculinity, femininity and relationships, I would have to say that it completely takes out the intimate aspect of the act altogether. Todays society believes that sex is just a physical act, and nothing more. Much of the music we hear glorifies the action of intercourse and the female physique but never focuses on the relationship aspect of the subject. These messages are harmful because they provoke a message of doing it just to do it (sounds stupid, I know) which doesnt help people make entirely smart choices.
Tucker  from Wilmington, N.C., suggested that health classes teach about healthy relationships, not just body parts:
OK, lets all take a breather before I start writing. In a way, it is just in human nature to explore what we dont understand, and sadly sex can fall into that category. Yes, porn is bad when exposed to society, but people learn better from experience. The issue is that nobody wants to teach us about the issue. We dont need to learn all about the urethra and tubular organs, but rather a brief explanation as to how it works. I find that all media has shaped not only the idea of sex but love in general. Face it, you cant just fall in love in a session of detention or show up in your red Porsche while you swipe a girl off her heels. The real world takes time to learn what love is, believe me, Im still learning. If we can just teach people how a healthy relationship works without having them surf the private web, if we can have more talks to teach youth before theyre sent off holding hands, just maybe we can be rid of these concepts about what love looks like from a computer screen.
Bradly from Wilmington, N.C., proposed banning pornography to solve this problem:
The topic of unrealistic and overstimulating sex also referred to as porn is a disgusting site that brainwashes anyone watching it into its lies and deceit. I dont believe the vocabulary and or content of pornography has any purpose being on the free ranged internet, let alone in the minds of unpredictable teenagers. I just dont understand why we are even debating the fact that porn influences the way teenagers think about sex, of course it does. When one is exposed to graphic material portraying a dominant man overtaking a weak female, that is exactly how teenagers will perceive sex to be in real life. In real life, women are portrayed as strong, dominant figures, not sex idols. The only solution to changing the way teenagers think about sex now is by destroying ponography and its content permanently. Doing this will not only save the present, but the many more to come in the future.
But Zac from Wilmington, N.C., disagreed with that approach:
Our nations sex education is appalling. The fact that only half of our fifty states mandate sexual education is absolutely insane. Its no wonder teens go to porn at such an early age. Our own schools completely shut down any talk of sex during the most important time of development in adolescence. Teens everywhere are going through so many changes they dont understand and are beginning to look at the world in different ways and our response is silence. It should be no shock to anyone that so many people were first exposed to sex through porn. Im in no way justifying minors watching porn, but for a lot of people, its all theyve got. Of course porn is impressionable on someone who has no other experience with sex. The problem is when teens only have porn. When no one is there to let them know the possible dangers of sex. When teens dont understand that its bigger than just the act itself. Sex education is vital in the upbringing of any child. I think we should move away from blaming porn itself and instead see that the problem may lie within our societies education systems.

For our Picture Prompt, Problem, we asked students what they thought the above image was trying to say and how it connected to current events. Heres what they came up with:
Tanya Bolick from North Carolina wrote:
When I first looked at the image I was confused. After a few minutes of looking I finally came to the realizations that the cloth represents how we like to cover up our problems, and leave them for later. But the thing is, no matter how hard we try to cover up our problems, the cloth is always too thin. You can never fully cover it up or remove the problem from your life until you face it head on. If you keep putting it off you might let the problem get too big. You could leave it until it is so bad that there is no longer anything you can do about it.
The article shows that Puerto Rico is a perfect example of this. The island is a prime hurricane location and feels the pain of it every day. After Hurricane Maria the island was greatly damaged. Due to its lack of funding, Puerto Ricos electrical system was in bad shape and the island experienced many blackouts. After Hurricane Maria it is worse than it ever was before. Due to the lack of power during and after the hurricane the water treatment plants have not been able to do their job. Many people are still being advised to boil their water before drinking. All these problems could have been mostly avoided if we had dealt with these problems in advance, or at least as they came; the situation would not be this bad.
Lauren Thornton from Providence, R.I., interpreted it this way:
I think this image is shedding a light on how things in todays society that were overlooked are now being exposed and spoken out against. From protesting against deporting Dreamers to YouTubers basically boycotting a makeup brand because they arent inclusive to all shades of skin, problems in our society are no longer just an at home discussion. Problems in our society are no longer being tolerated because there are so many people who have the platforms to be able to condemn them. Its 2018 now, and we have the power to push for progress. I think this image is a sign of progress and it encourages people to speak out.
Clay Krupp from N.C. said succinctly:
I believe that this picture is used as a symbol that we are running out of solutions for our current event problems. The covered part symbolizes problems that have solutions or have been solved. The uncovered part symbolizes the unsolved problems in our society.
And Ellie Hannum from Wilmington, N.C., connected it to the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla.:
Often times the simplest art is also the most impactful. At first glance, the image portrays the fact that humans tend to deal with problems by covering them up, therefore not actually fixing the issue. The more I gazed at the image, I also noticed that the thin bandage only wraps around part of the word. This could be interpreted as only fixing or addressing part of a problem. The uncovered part of the problem is left unsolved. This image reminds me of the recent shooting that occurred in Florida this past week. To call the increasing number of school shootings in America a problem is a huge understatement. It is a nightmare that does not end for families all over the country and that our government is struggling to find a solution to. It is as if our country has a broken bone and we are trying to heal by putting a band-aid on it. We might be covering the surface of the wound but the problem still exists beneath the surface. We cant expect to solve our countrys problems with simple solutions.

Our Student Opinion question Should Technology in Sports Be Limited? drew in responses from both sides of the debate.
Josh Failla from Wilmington, N.C., gave this compelling argument in support of technology:
Watching the Olympics for the past week has showed how the difference between 1st and 10th place is sometimes is only 1 second. It seems that the human body has begun to peak in its ability to go faster. According to the data in the article, around 2005, times began to plateau. Times were becoming very similar, and it took a full decade to beat the speed skater record by Denis Yuskov. This shows me that technology needs to be a key part in not only speed skating, but other sports around the world.
A competitors goal is to always become better, faster, and stronger. It seems nowadays that the only way athletes can improve is with the implication of technology. Technology will also influence how many people will watch the sport. Viewers dont want to see the same speed every year, and with the implication of technology, athletes will performing better than ever, giving more awareness to the sport. If the only way that athletes can improve is through technology, then so be it. I just dont want it to come down to robots playing the sports.
Brennan Litzinger from Wilmington, N.C., agreed and gave an example:
One sport that I can think of that has definitely increased its technology over the years would be football. Back when football was just becoming a sport the players only had leather helmets, I mean you might as well wear paper on your head. As a football player myself I really understand the need for technology in football. As much as we try to avoid them, head to head collisions on the field are a real thing. I believe technology has really taken a big role in preventing concussions and other injuries in football, and it has definitely changed the game.
Nick Hargrove from Wilmington, N.C., offered a counterpoint:
The Peak Olympics have arrived as seen in the graphs depicted in the interactive article. Up until around 1980 scores in the 800 meter run, high jump, and shot put all improved, until the scores plateaued in 1980. In another graph shown in the interactive article, you can see the male height in the United States showed a significant increase up until 1950. There the heights plateaued, even slightly decreasing in the 90s. While technology may advance in the future the human performance of the Olympics has reached its peak.
I do not think athletes should be allowed to use technology to improve their performance. Once a technology becomes crucial in order to compete at a high level, it then provides wealthier countries an advantage. Once technology provides a substantial advantage, the sport no longer is entirely about human performance and becomes about a factor that does not encourage things like dedication to the sport. Not only does it provide a disadvantage to others currently competing, it diminishes the scores and legacy of past athletes. They need to provide stricter guidelines that stay constant throughout the years so that an scores can be compared to past scores. While some may argue technology improves scores these results are inflated by something that people in the past didnt have access to. There comes to a point where technology will be providing advantages at a level such as PEDs which are currently disallowed throughout sports.
Hugo Veliz from Providence, R.I., also thought technology should be restricted:
Personally, I believe that technology should be used in sports but only to improve the fairness of the game. For example, in the World Cup, they should improve the goal-line techno to truly find out if the soccer ball fully went over the line. The limits of technology in sports should be like athletes using the technology to enhance their skills to outdo their opponent unfairly.
Kasey Kiser from Wilmington, N.C., came up with a creative solution to bolster athleticism without new technology:
I believe we have reached Peak Olympics, especially in some events. Take for example skeleton or most timed events. Ive witnessed countless runs within milliseconds of each other, making me question the appeal for that sport. Personally, Im attracted to events where the competition doesnt come in nitpicky ways, like how well you hugged a turn. I tend to watch the events like hockey, snowboarding, or other events where more grit, emotion, and even flaws are visible to the average viewer. Id rather see raw athletic ability than reproducible clones of the sport. The plateau of times due to human limits could definitely be boosted by new technology. But like before, if you hand the entire human race a task and give them decades to refine and perfect their skills, it will eventually reach a threshold. Adding new tech may stir up the competition for a few Olympic games, but once it becomes mainstream, well eventually run into the same issue.
My solution for the Olympics introduces new modifications, or even new events entirely. Why watch the same thing every 4 years when new obstacles and challenges can be created to entertain the audience? Many might argue that changing the games will ruin the careers of athletes and trainers, along with the integrity of the sport. However, the Olympics and any competition for that matter are in the business of entertainment. If you cant keep viewers glued to the screen, in awe of amazing competition, its time to switch it up.
But Derek Han from San Jose, Calif., thinks technology will allow humans to surpass what the authors call Peak Olympics:
I think that humans are not at their peak in many sports. The authors are arguing that because the difference in performance times are becoming smaller and smaller, the athletes seem to be reaching a peak performance level at which they will no longer be able to improve, or will only be able to improve through improved technology. I completely disagree with this for multiple reasons. From what Ive seen, athletes are getting more and more skilled. For my example, Ill use running. Specifically, the mile run. In 1855, the first recorded mile time record on a track was set, with a time of 4:28:00. Thats ridiculously slow for a professional. Even my friend can run a mile faster than that. By 1886, the mile record had dropped to 4:12:75. From 1945 to 1954, the record had been 4:01:40, until it was broken with a time of 3:59:40. From 1855 to 1954, the record has gone down by 29 seconds. Now, the record stands at 3:43:13. In 64 years, the record has gone down by 16 seconds. Between 1954 and 2018, the record has gone down by an average of four seconds per year, while between 1855 and 1954, the record has gone down by an average of 3.41 seconds. The athletes in this case are actually improving more quickly as time goes by, rather than plateauing. With the new technology that is being made, athletes arent getting an unfair advantage to boost their performance, athletes are actually improving the same amount as they did back in the 1850s, when track spikes were first being produced.

Our Picture Prompt for Valentines Day brought out both the lovers and the cynics.
Monalene Delo from Wilmington, N.C., likes what this holiday stands for:
I love Valentines Day! It is the one day of the year where love, joy and cheer is spread and the focus is simply love. Often times in this world where there is so much hate, we need a reminder to be good to one another. To spread love. This holiday provides a time to support others in ways that they normally wouldnt. For instance at school students might spend a day making valentines for friends and family. Just by making a simple card people on the receiving end feel appreciated and loved. Significant others may even go out of their way to make sure their spouses have a wonderful day, by buying candies, cards and stuffed animals. This day promotes friendships and joy. It encourages you to do something nice for others, like making a Valentines Day card for someone in a nursing home that may have lost their loved one. I think it is a beautiful reminder to be good to one another. Valentines Day is not about the materialistic things. On Valentines Day I saw big bears, candies and flowers lining the halls as gifts to their girlfriends, how happy it made them. Heres the thing, flowers will die and the chocolate candies will get eaten, then what is left? When there is no more presents being given, no more cards to show how much you care. Will we still spread love and kindness? I hope that we continue to even after the day ends.
Timosha Fesenko from Rhode Island does not:
I remember Valentines Day before high school when kids were more interested in getting their sugar fix then finding a Valentine. Now? I would only take part in Valentines Day if I were in a relationship. If not, I dont believe anything Id do would be very genuine, which is the main reason Im not a fan of Valentines Day. If you love someone, or want to ask them out on a date or something, why wait until Valentines Day? Most others are doing the exact same thing, so why not do it when no one else is?
Jeraldyn Ramirez from Rhode Island thinks Valentines Day is about more than just romantic love:
Valentines Day is another excuse to dress up and eat dinner. I love Valentines Day because it is a day for you to eat as much candy without being judged, although I eat it no matter what day it is. I dont hate this holiday because it is just another day to show your love and appreciation for the people around you. I think the reason why many people dislike the holiday is because of the assumption that you need to be in a relationship to enjoy it. This is not the case, however, because it is just a day about love. To prove this assumption wrong, we can look at the name for Valentines Day in Spanish that some use to refer to it, being Dia de la Amistad. This means the day of friendship. I apply this definition to celebrate the holiday. I make plans with my friends and go out for a meal.
Kerly3D from YC CLIP agreed:
I think Valentines Day is a perfect day to show others how much you love them. It is not necessary to be in a relationship because you can show love to your parents, family or friends. Most people confuse this day with giving gifts and spending a lot of money, but it is not about that, a person can make happy another by sharing, treating and giving love and happiness on this day. I know some people do not agree with me, and maybe they think that we can share and give love every day, but I think it is good, at least one day, remembering with more emphasis the meaning of the love.
But Marcelo3D from YC CLIP said it had become too commercialized:
In my opinion, Valentines Day is an amazing day for the couples and for friends but I do not really care so much this day. I think that this day is a commercial day, created so that couples spend money on gifts but is not a bad day because in this day, many couples forgot their problems for one day and they concentrate on having the best day. Another thing that you can do in this day is spend time with your family and this is a good point for this day because not every day we can see all of our familiars and this is a good day to see them.
Maddie Leber from Wilmington, N.C., noticed her feelings have changed as she has gotten older:
I always remember loving Valentines Day when I was little, but lets be honest. It was a day where everyone in your class would give you cards and candy and you barely did any work, but over the years Ive grown to resent it. Now its just another day where people are walking around holding bears with hearts and chocolate prices sky-rocket. I had always believed Valentines Day was a day only for people in love, and if you didnt have a significant other then you werent included. Ive now realized its just a day to let people know you love them. This is the first year Ive celebrated Valentines Day since those days in elementary school where I would give out those little cards with puppies on them that came with stickers. This year Ive made cards for everyone in my family and plan on buying candy for my friends, but not until tomorrow, because then its half-off.
And Gloria3D from YC CLIP believes love should be celebrated all year round:
Valentines Day is s day for the commercial business because if you see the season in February after Christmas the sales are low. Them the commerce need to activate and what better way than create a day for in love. For you demonstrate to someone that you have any love feeling for this person not necessary have that it is this day every day, every moment you can do it. Personally I every day I say my daughters, my husband and other person during the day I love you, not necessary with words almost with attitudes. I give them a hug, biscuits, hot chocolate or simply you say them something beautiful. You can use this way. You do not want the commercial day for you say, you are important for me.

TALLAHASSEE  Seven days after the killing of 17 students and school staff members in Florida, Republican state leaders are facing pressure unlike any they have experienced before to pass legislation addressing gun violence.
On Wednesday, swarms of student protesters carrying signs and boxes of petitions stormed the Florida Capitol, pleading with lawmakers to pass tougher gun control in the wake of the deadly shooting at a Broward County school last week.
On one floor, they crowded the doorway of the office of Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican and an ardent supporter of gun rights, shouting, Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! On an upper floor, they gathered outside the office of the powerful speaker of the Florida House, Richard Corcoran. Face us down! Face us down! Face us down!
And on the House floor, Alondra Gittelson, who survived the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, confronted Mr. Corcoran, a Republican, demanding to know why such a destructive gun  the AR-15 rifle  is widely accessible.
How is an individual in society able to acquire such a gun? Ms. Gittelson, 16, asked Mr. Corcoran.
Mr. Corcoran replied that he saw the rifle as a legitimate hunting weapon and did not believe a ban would help matters. Ill just be honest with you, he said. Me, personally  I dont believe thats the solution.
With about two weeks left in the legislative session, Republicans led by Mr. Scott have concluded that it would be politically catastrophic if they failed to do something to address the growing outcry. But they appear likely to pursue legislation narrower than what students are demanding, avoiding a ban on assault weapons.
In the Florida House and Senate, lawmakers said they were involved in bipartisan efforts to craft gun-related legislative proposals that could be introduced Friday or earlier.
State Senator Bill Galvano, a Republican, said in an interview that the Senate proposal would likely involve raising the age to purchase semiautomatic rifles to 21 from 18; introducing a three-day waiting period to purchase such guns; banning bump stocks, an attachment that enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster; and expanding the power of law enforcement to restrict the actions of mentally ill people under Floridas Baker Act.
Nothing about this is par for the course, Mr. Galvano said. Weve had one too many horrific incidents in this country and really around the world. And to have this tragedy occur here in the State of Florida has in some ways been very sobering.
He added that there was a true commitment in the Senate and the House to try to address issues that would prevent something this devastating from ever happening again.
In addition to the students amassing in Tallahassee, Democrats in Florida have vowed to make gun control a central campaign issue in 2018, and a national gun-control group is already targeting Mr. Scott with television ads that say he neglected public safety.
The developing clash over firearms has the potential to define Florida politics in a critical election year, thrusting the state into the center of a stalemated national debate around gun violence and the Second Amendment. In a politically divided state where the National Rifle Association has held broad influence for decades  every governor for 20 years has been an ally of the group  even fierce supporters of gun rights now believe Republicans cannot afford to seem passive in response to gruesome scenes of violence.
The arrival of the student protesters from Stoneman Douglas, who traveled hundreds of miles by bus to the state capital, drastically raised the political stakes for Floridas long-ruling Republicans. Having reached Tallahassee overnight, the young activists quickly set about advocating for sweeping new gun restrictions, included expanded background checks for gun purchases and an outright ban on the sale of military-style firearms.
Inside the Capitol, the students divided into groups of 10. Senator Lauren Book, a Democrat, had helped the students arrange meetings with lawmakers in both parties, and the groups planned to meet with some 70 elected officials.
Throughout the day, the Stoneman Douglas students moved through the labyrinthine building, and met for 20 or 30 minutes at a time with lawmakers in their offices. They crowded around small conference tables and packed onto leather couches or sat cross-legged on nubby carpets.
Some lawmakers asked for photographs they could use for promotional materials. At least one, a Democrat, pulled students into a picture before even introducing himself.
Group No. 6 crammed into the elevator with two parent chaperones. They met with Representative Patricia H. Williams, a Democrat, and Senator Debbie Mayfield, a Republican. Ms. Mayfield said that changes were needed, perhaps including raising the minimum age to buy powerful weapons, but she rebuffed criticism from a student, Daniel Bishop, 16, that such a change would not actually prevent deaths.
We cant stop crazies, she told the group.
Afterward, Amanda De La Cruz, 16, looked distraught. I want the ban on semiautomatic weapons, she said. I dont care about the crazies.
Will Weatherford, a former speaker of the Florida House, said on Tuesday that the ferocious public response to the Parkland shooting exposed pent-up feelings of horror and fear that have mounted over time. Mr. Weatherford, a conservative Republican, said legislators might be able to move quickly on a few tailored proposals, such as raising the legal age for possessing assault rifles.
With Pulse, with what took place in Las Vegas, theres been an aggregate effect, Mr. Weatherford said, referring to the mass killings in 2016 and 2017 at an Orlando nightclub and an outdoor concert in Las Vegas. All of it is adding up and theres a lot of frustration thats boiling over.
Mr. Weatherford said he expected the Legislature to take action of some kind, but cautioned: Its hard to write a thoughtful policy in three weeks.
Proponents of stricter gun control, however, seem unlikely to be appeased by what they perceive as half-measures. Students at the Capitol Wednesday denounced the Legislature for having voted down a proposal on Tuesday to consider banning assault weapons. The people around us failed us, declared Delaney Tarr, a student at Stoneman Douglas. And if they continue to fail us, then they will no longer be in office because soon we will have the ability to vote, and we will vote them out.
The mood in the Capitol grew progressively more contentious throughout the day, as respectful disagreements between students and lawmakers gave way to blunt expressions of indignation by frustrated activists. By the afternoon, the Stoneman Douglas students had been joined by thousands of other Floridians, including college students, who had come to voice their support for changes to gun laws.
The revival of gun regulation as a political issue comes at a precarious moment in Florida politics, as a polarizing president warps traditional political boundaries in a state he narrowly won in 2016. Republicans in Florida have experienced several setbacks recently in special elections, as traditionally Republican-friendly voters have deserted the party in heavily suburban and Hispanic areas. Representative Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat from the Orlando area, said voters in her largely suburban district had reached a breaking point.
People are angry and theyre outraged and theyre motivated, said Ms. Murphy, who defeated an N.R.A.-backed candidate after the Pulse shooting in 2016.
This year, control of Floridas governorship, the State Senate, several congressional seats and a United States Senate seat are expected to be intensely contested.
The growing pressure on Florida Republicans may reflect the changing national contours of the gun debate, which for years has been shaped chiefly by ardent supporters of the Second Amendment who vote in force. While several Democratic-leaning states, like Connecticut and Colorado, passed ambitious gun-violence laws after mass shootings, no state wholly controlled by Republicans has enacted legislation even on the comparatively modest scale currently being contemplated in Florida.
As a matter of electoral politics, the Republican with the most at stake may be Mr. Scott, a wealthy former hospital executive who is closely aligned with the N.R.A. Mr. Scott has been moving to challenge Senator Bill Nelson, a long-serving Democrat who supports gun control, and the governors political allies believe passing some form of public-safety legislation is essential to his prospects in the race.
A commercial blasting Mr. Scott for rejecting policies that could keep Florida children safe was released this week by Giffords, a gun control group founded by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot outside an Arizona supermarket in 2011, and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly.
The Stoneman Douglas students saved their final meeting on Wednesday  a two-hour sit-down to which the press was not invited  with Mr. Scott. Afterward, one student, Piero Guerra, 15, said the governor had been kind of neutral on their proposal to ban semiautomatic rifles but had been adamant in support of mental health reforms.
The meeting with the governor ended after dark, and Mr. Guerra and his classmates headed for the three buses that would take them some eight hours home to Parkland.
Lindsey Salomone, 15, said that after a day speaking with lawmakers  she sat next to the governor during their meeting  she was ready to go home and do the real work: grieve.
I was in the building; my friends were shot in my class, she said. So emotionally, Im pretty much in shock. Im not feeling anything, actually.
She added, But everybody is telling me: It will come.

This morning, Ill be asking them what they have heard, creating opportunity to verbalize as well as acknowledge their feelings. Well spend some time either writing or drawing as a way to release the energy. Well review lockdown procedures for our school. We will do this daily.
We also heard from Clara Green, a social emotional learning coach in Atlantas public schools. She sent this email to the teachers she supports:
I am absolutely heartbroken by the horrific school shooting in Parkland, Florida. This morning, it is more critical than ever than we make students feel welcomed at school. Many of your students may come to school with strong emotions and questions and we must provide a safe space for them to cope with this traumatic event.
In talking about this event with elementary-aged students, she and the American School Counselor Association recommend doing the following:
 Trying to keep routines as normal as possible. Kids gain security from the predictability of routine, including attending school.
 Limiting exposure to television and the news.
 Being honest with kids and share with them as much information as they are developmentally able to handle.
 Listening to kids fears and concerns.
 Reassuring kids that the world is a good place to be, but that there are people who do bad things.
 Rebuilding and reaffirming attachments and relationships.
Another teacher, Kristin Hunt Runyon, said she will be doing the following:
Reviewing Alice (Active Shooter Civilian Response Training) protocol
Reminding students to report warning signs of mental health issues and possible threats to an adult
Explaining why my classroom door will remain locked every day from now on because it is the only tool we have to protect our students inside the classroom.
And Stacy Matros Hardcastle wrote about the role of school in students lives:
We have to make our schools places where students feel a human connection. Places where they would never, ever think to bring a gun to campus.
If there is ever even a whisper that someone has the plan to bring a gun, our teachers and students should be able to communicate freely with law enforcement so that those plans are stopped. There need to be policies that would have allowed physical intervention as soon as yesterdays shooter posted one of the many disturbing things he did on his social media.
We need to protect each other.
Because The Learning Network is for students 13 and older, the resources below focus on understanding this shooting and its implications, but parents and teachers of younger students might find this advice, published by The Times after the shooting in Newton, Conn., helpful. Our friends at Scholastic also offer these Resources for Responding to Violence and Tragedy.

Before addressing any traumatic event with students of any age, however, you might read our advice on talking about sensitive issues in the news.
We have also created a forum where students can share their thoughts. Invite yours to post answers to the question, What Is Your Reaction to the Deadly Shooting at a Florida High School?
We will continue to update this post.
_________
Understand What Happened and React to It
To learn more about the shooting on Feb. 14 and its aftermath, students might read the article Florida School Shooting Death Toll Is at 17 and Could Rise and answer these questions:
1. How many people were killed and injured in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.?
2. Who was the gunman? What weapons did he use? What has he been charged with?
3. What evidence do the police have that shows the attack was premeditated, or planned?
4. How does this school shooting compare with others in modern United States history?
5. What were the initial responses of parents and school officials to the attack?
6. How did students describe the scene inside the school?
7. After learning more about what happened, what are your reactions to this tragedy?
You can continue to follow the latest updates here, and your students can post their thoughts about what they read in answer to this related Student Opinion question: What Is Your Reaction to the Deadly Shooting at a Florida High School?

Recognize and Honor the Victims and Heroes
Have students read about the 14 children and 3 adults who lost their lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and think about the different ways they could be commemorated.
Students might create a collage or bulletin board profile of the victims, perhaps modeling them on a Times feature like the annual Lives They Lived or the Portraits of Grief series, which profiled those lost in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Amid this tragedy, there are also stories of great courage and benevolence. Encourage your students to look for the helpers  those that risked their own lives and safety to help others. What heroic acts have they read about?
What acts of service can students offer to recognize, honor and celebrate the victims? Brainstorm ways you may be able to offer condolences to the families or the community of Parkland, Fla., or do a related service learning project that grows out of students thoughts and feelings about these events, the victims lives, the needs of school communities, or actions they can take to prevent tragedies like this in the future.

School Shootings in Context

                Since 26 people were killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, a nonprofit that tracks school shootings has recorded five a month, on average.            
Invite students to study the graphic above. What does it say about school shootings in the United States? What does that make them think and feel? Why?
In the related article, Jugal K. Patel writes:
More than 40 active shooter episodes in schools have been recorded in the United States since 2000, according to F.B.I. and news reports. Two 15-year-old students were killed and 18 more people were injured last month in a school in rural Benton, Ky. The shootings have become common enough that many schools, including Stoneman Douglas High, run annual drills in which students practice huddling in classrooms behind locked doors.
With the Parkland shooting, three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history have come in the last five months.
In fact, lockdown drills are now such a common feature of the school experience that a high school student who was one of the winners of our Editorial Contest last year wrote an essay, Stopping Bullets With Locked Doors and Silence Is Already Pulling the Trigger. In it she argues:
It has become very familiar for high-school students to practice the infamous level-three lockdown. In all cases, we all share the semi-nervous chuckle of wow, maybe we get Swiss-cheesed today and sit in a corner, stare at our phones and text our friends. Only very recently, after a vivid dream  more a nightmare  of a school shooting, did I realize that sitting in the dark and stopping bullets with locked doors and silence is the exact opposite of what one would want to do. It wasnt until I stumbled upon the fact that the people shot and killed in the Columbine library sat there for five minutes before the shooters entered and shot them. My school is full of able-bodied kids, and surprisingly, a great chunk that has had experience with self-defense and even marksmen training. So why sit and wait?
Has your school been affected by gun violence? What measures do you have in place to prevent future violence, or to respond to threats? Ask students to investigate if they cant answer that question, then discuss: Do you think your school and community are doing enough to prevent future shootings? If not, what else do you think they should do? What do you think individual students can do, if anything?

 Are We Becoming Numb to School Shootings?
Thousands of readers have commented on the article about the Parkland shooting. One by Tom from Vermont sums up what hes read:
The comments here seem so stark and brief. Understandably so, what is left to say? It is becoming so easy to see a headline like the one on this story and shrug. This is the new America. But is it? Something inside me still makes me think we have the resolve to turn this terrible tide.
On The Learning Network, we responded to a shooting in Benton, Ky. in January by posing the question, Are We Becoming Numb to School Shootings? It was in reaction to an article headlined, School Shooting in Kentucky Was Nations 11th of Year. It Was Jan. 23. Seventy students answered, and the question is still open to comment if your students would like to weigh in.
Nathanie Doralus from Florida wrote:
As a student, I agree that weve become numb to the news of school shootings in the United States. My high school has already had two lockdowns this school year because of students bringing guns onto the campus. It happens so often that I think many feel powerless to stop them so the default is to either ignore them or solemnly shake your head in silence. In some ways, I think its an attempt to not live in constant fear while attending school and receiving an education because no one should have to. But in other ways, I think some wont take it seriously until it hits close to home. If we were taking school shootings more seriously than before, then there wouldnt have been eleven incidents already in the first month of this year. Very few people take active assailant drills at my school seriously. I think that is just an example of denial and how its hard to take something seriously unless it actually happens to you or someone you know. Schools can do more than just increasing their security measures and frequently enacting drills. They can also invest in the mental health and well-being of their students and provide the support some of them need in order to prevent these acts of violence.
And Jocelyn Savard from North Carolina shared this perspective:
In Boston, there are a series of billboards promoting gun violence awareness. One reads Americans killed since the massacre at Sandy Hook and has a live count of citizen owned gun deaths displayed. I remember walking around a few years ago and being startled at the number. When Sandy Hook happened and my mom told me, I cried for days. Just a few days ago when the notifications showed up on my phone about Kentucky, I barely blinked an eye. Of course, my heart plummeted and I could feel humanitys downfall one step closer but there was no tears, at church this weekend there was no announcement, no prayer. As a country, we have normalized school shootings so much, made books and movies out of them, make offhand comments about how that guy looks like a school shooter, that we are rapidly becoming detached to the horror that we call our home.
Do your students agree with these teenagers that we are rapidly becoming detached to the horror of school shootings? Why or why not?

How has this latest attack affected them? What do they think we might do to keep from becoming detached?

The Role of Students: Cellphones and Social Media 
Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., hid in closets as a gunman fired a semiautomatic weapon into their classrooms. Seventeen people were killed.
Technology has allowed the public to witness mass shootings in new and terrifying ways. The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School used their cellphones and social media accounts in real time to share their experiences and spread messages of pain, anger and gratitude, as well as calls to action.
In As Shots Ring Out, a Student Texts: If I Dont Make It, I Love You, Audra D.S. Burch and Patricia Mazzei write:
One student hit her record button while being led out of the school to safety by sheriffs deputies. On her way, her cellphones shaking camera lens passed over several bodies sprawled on the floor.
In another cellphone video, several dozen gunshots were audible not far away. Oh my God! Oh my God! one student shouted.
Like many school districts, Broward Countys allows high school students to bring cellphones to school, so long as they dont interfere with class work. On Wednesday, many students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School held onto their phones for dear life as a 19-year-old gunman, Nikolas Cruz, stalked the grounds and fatally shot 17 people. They used them to keep their terrified parents informed about what was happening. And they used them to keep a visual record of an awful crime.
Hiding in a sweltering storage room with about 40 other students, she typed out a text message to her mother, Stacy, for what she thought might be the last time.
If I dont make it, she wrote, I love you and I appreciate everything you did for me.
Students also took to Twitter to post the texts they thought might be their last to their family and friends:

            this is a conversation someone should never have with their family. We go to school to learn, not to get shot. For some this was their last conversation with their loved ones #PrayforDouglas #GUNviolence pic.twitter.com/FNCREQ2eik 
Ask your students:
Whare are your reactions to these firsthand accounts of the violence that took place in Parkland, Fla.?
How have these videos impacted the public conversation around guns and school safety? Why do you think they have had such a dramatic effect? Do you think the fact that your generation is so fluent in social media gives you a voice previous generations did not have? What might be the benefits and drawbacks of that if so?

The Role of Students: They Survived the School Shooting. Now Theyre Calling for Action

            Student David Hogg who survived the school shooting looks directly in the camera, and sends a message to President Trump and lawmakers: Please, take action. Ideas are great… But whats more important is actual action… saving thousands of childrens lives. Please, take action. pic.twitter.com/C5mf9qPlqA 
On Feb. 15, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School implored lawmakers to act to prevent future violence, calling the frequency of school shootings in the United States unacceptable.
Ideas are great, ideas are wonderful and they help you get re-elected and everything, but whats more important is actual action, the student, David Hogg, said on CNN.
Mr. Hogg, whose younger sister lost two friends in the shooting, called on politicians to act.
Were children, he said. You guys are the adults.
Advertisement
Since then, as The Times writes, youthful voices have resonated where those of longtime politicians have largely fallen flat, and many see in that a reason for hope.
As David Leonhardt writes:
...the movement to reduce gun violence seems to have a new energy, driven by students  who of course have provided much of the energy for previous political movements. Individual schools have already held or planned walkouts. A nationwide protest is scheduled for March 14, with help from organizers of the Womens March. Teachers are also talking about mass protest, as Slates Dahlia Lithwick explains.
In A Mass Shooting Generation Cries Out for Change, The Times points out that teenagers today have grown up with code-red drills, and they have a perspective many adults do not:
This is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it.
Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 students this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices  in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman  are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting.
While many politicians after the shooting were focused on mental health and safety, some vocal students at Stoneman Douglas High showed no reluctance in drawing attention to gun control.
They called out politicians over Twitter, with one student telling Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. Shortly after the shooting, Cameron Kasky, a junior at the school, and a few friends started a Never Again campaign on Facebook that shared stories and perspectives from other students who survived the rampage.
Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control.
What do your students think about these activist teenagers and their messages? What messages or ideas resonate with them the most?
Can their generation effect real change on gun violence? How? What examples are they reading or hearing about  or witnessing themselves  that seem to be having an impact? What are their own personal opinions about what should be done, how and why? What can each of us do as individuals, and what can people their age do together?
As many have pointed out, it was widespread student activism during the era of the civil rights movement and the war in Vietnam that helped change history. And as we learned from the students who participated in our recent News Diet Challenge, teenagers can feel overwhelmed by the news unless they can find a way to act on what they read.
To learn more, invite them to read Emma González Leads a Student Outcry on Guns: This Is the Way I Have to Grieve and watch the related videos, including the one below:
They can also read an Op-Ed in The Times by a freshman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. In Dont Let My Classmates Deaths Be in Vain, Christine Yared writes:
We cant let innocent peoples deaths be in vain. We need to work together beyond political parties to make sure this never happens again. We need tougher gun laws.
If a person is not old enough to be able to rent a car or buy a beer, then he should not be able to legally purchase a weapon of mass destruction. This could have been prevented. If the killer had been properly treated for his mental illness, maybe this would not have happened. If there were proper background checks, then those who should not have guns would not have them.
We need to vote for those who are for stricter laws and kick out those who wont take action. We need to expose the truth about gun violence and the corruption around guns. Please.
Invite your class to respond to the Student Opinion question we have posted: Can High School Students Make a Real Impact on the Problem of Gun Violence in the United States?
And if they are interested in more ideas for taking action beyond those these young people have already suggested, our lesson plan Ideas for Student Civic Action in a Time of Social Uncertainty might offer ideas.

The AR-15 and Gun Control
The AR-15 assault rifle, and others like it, is commonly used in mass shootings in the United States. Here's a closer look at likely reasons.
The New York Times reports that the gunman who killed 17 people and injured others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School used an AR-15 assault rifle. This style of rifle was also used in the attacks in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex., among others.
Students might watch the video above, then discuss: What are some of the reasons that the AR-15, and other weapons like it, have become so common in mass shootings? How does it compare with other types of guns?
Advertisement
In recent years the regulation of the sale of this style of rifle has come to the forefront of the national gun debate. In a 2017 appeal to the Connecticut Supreme Court, relatives of victims in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School argued:
The companies that manufactured and sold the military-style assault rifle used by the gunman should be held responsible for the 2012 attack.
A lawsuit filed by the relatives said that the AR-15-style Bushmaster used to carry out the shooting in Newtown, Conn., that killed 26 people, including 20 first graders, was specifically marketed as a weapon of war, with slogans and product placement in video games invoking the violence of combat. The lawsuit claims that such promotions were a deliberate effort to make the weapon attractive to young men, like Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman.
At the same time, the National Rifle Association has taken to calling the AR-15 Americas rifle and gun owners say that the AR-15 is used for hunting, sport shooting and self-defense.
Ask students: Do you think AR-15-style rifles should be more strictly regulated in the United States? Why or why not?
Do you think any other measures should be taken to restrict access to guns? If so, what? If not, what else can be done to prevent more mass shootings like this one?
Students might read how others responded to these questions after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and add their voices to the conversation by commenting here since that post is now closed.
Or, take a look at the forum on guns we posted during the 2016 election as part of our Civil Conversation Challenge  for teenagers. We invited students to have productive, respectful conversations on several issues dividing Americans, and more than 700 responses came in to the questions we posed about gun rights, the Second Amendment and more.
Update: The Times has now published a piece that summarizes political responses: Right and Left React to the Gun Control Debate After the Florida Shooting.
_________
Only in the United States?
In How to Reduce Shootings, the columnist Nicholas Kristof writes:
Inevitably, predictably, fatefully, another mass shooting breaks our hearts. This time, it was a school shooting in Florida on Wednesday that left at least 17 dead at the hands of 19-year-old gunman and his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.
But what is perhaps most heartbreaking of all is that they shouldnt be shocking. People all over the world become furious and try to harm others, but only in the United States do we suffer such mass shootings so regularly; only in the United States do we lose one person every 15 minutes to gun violence.
He writes that we should learn lessons from these tragedies, so that there can be fewer of them. In particular, I suggest that we try a new approach to reducing gun violence  a public health strategy.
Invite your students to take a look at the graphics from a visual essay he did in November after the church shooting in Texas. What do they see? What questions do the charts raise? To what extent do they agree with Mr. Kristofs conclusions?

The Gunman
What do authorities know so far about the shooter? What is not yet known?
In Nikolas Cruz, Florida Shooting Suspect, Was Expelled From School, Matthew Haag and Serge F. Kovaleski write:
The man suspected of opening fire inside a Florida high school on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, is a former student who had been expelled for disciplinary reasons, the authorities said.
… In the hours after the shooting, people who knew Mr. Cruz described him as a troubled kid who enjoyed showing off his firearms, bragging about killing animals and whose mother would resort to calling the police to have them come to their home to try to talk some sense into him. At a school with about 3,000 students, Mr. Cruz stayed to himself and had few friends but struck fear in some students with erratic behavior and an affinity for violence.
… In the interview with the Miami news station, the student said Mr. Cruz was a junior at Stoneman Douglas High School when he was expelled last year. He said that students would joke that if anyone were to open fire inside the school, it would be Mr. Cruz. Because of that, students feared him and mostly stayed away from him, the student said.
A lot of people were saying that it would be him, the student told WFOR-TV. They would say he would be the one to shoot up the school. Everyone predicted it.
In Nikolas Cruzs Lifetime of Trouble: Family Loss, Flashes of Rage, The Times writes that he has been causing trouble as long as anyone here could remember.
Do you think this attack could have been prevented? If so, how? If not, why not?
What might school administrators, teachers and students be able to learn from this attack to prevent others like it from happening? How could they respond to students who may be showing signs of trouble in school, on social media or at home?
What  if anything  should students do if they encounter others who display erratic behavior or inclinations toward violence?

Senators Amy Klobuchar, Steve Daines, Dianne Feinstein and others mixed facts and falsehoods in their televised talk with President Trump. 
By Linda Qiu
President Trump discussed potential solutions to curb gun violence on Wednesday during a televised meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers.
The president strayed from the facts during his remarks, as The New York Times reported previously. Here is a look at the claims made during the session by other lawmakers  Republicans and Democrats  that may have strayed from the facts or otherwise require some additional context. 
In the past, Ms. Feinstein has referenced an analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston, that found the assault weapons ban drastically reduced gun massacres.
But its difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to most experts and research. 
As The Times has previously reported:
The 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the Justice Department to argue that the ban could not be credited with any reduction in crime. 
On the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that the number of gun massacres fell by 37% while the ban was in place.
Christopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident.
My work is often cited in misleading ways that dont give the full picture, Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. These laws can modestly reduce shootings overall and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings.
A database maintained by Mother Jones, a progressive magazine, shows that 95 out of 97 mass shootings from 1982 to 2018 involved male gunmen. Fifty-five were committed by white men. 
Ms. Klobuchar is probably referring to a report from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, that claims 38 percent fewer women are shot to death by intimate partners in states that require background checks for all handgun sales. 
This analysis, however, does not account for other factors that contribute to domestic violence, leading other researchers to question the sweeping conclusion about background checks.
April Zeoli, a professor at Michigan State University who studies intimate partner violence, called the Everytown estimate a back of the napkin calculation.
Ms. Zeolis research has found that state laws restricting access to firearms for people who have been convicted of domestic violence result in declines in intimate partner homicides; specifically, 11 percent from laws that mandate buyers to get a permit whether theyre purchasing from licensed or private dealers, she said. (Other research also shows this.) 
Unlike Everytown, Ms. Zeoli also looked at state domestic violence laws, poverty and divorce rates, average amounts of public assistance, educational attainment gaps between men and women, homicides not related to domestic violence, percentage of suicides by firearms as a proxy for gun ownership rates and law enforcement availability. 
As Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Trump discussed concealed-carry laws, Mr. Trump said, Youre not allowed concealed in a gun-free zone. The exchange highlights how amorphous the term gun-free zone has become.
Federal law prohibits firearms in grade schools, but makes explicit exceptions for security personnel and instructional purposes (hunting classes, for example). So, Mr. Rutherford is wrong to state that there are never guns in gun-free zones. 
Furthermore, at least eight states allow concealed carry for teachers at grade schools, and two others have eased restrictions, according to the Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy group. 
Private businesses may also ban civilian use of firearms on their premises, but state laws vary on how and on the extent to which a business can opt out.
Texas has very specific requirements for the signs businesses put up to indicate that they do not allow firearms on their properties. (For example, they must be in both English and Spanish.) North Carolina requires signs to be conspicuous, while Florida has no explicit rules. Florida is one of 23 states that require business owners to allow guns in cars parked on company property.
When asked what data Mr. Scalise was referring to, a spokesman told The Times, Since the early 90s, the significant increase in the issuance of concealed-carry permits by states has been accompanied by a significant drop in violent crime rates  and that includes millions of new permits being issued in the last decade or so. 
The spokesman cited the work of John R. Lott Jr., an economist and gun rights advocate whose book More Guns, Less Crime makes the case that passing concealed-handgun laws deters violent crime. But Mr. Lotts findings have been questioned by other academics. 
In 2005, a panel at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded that no link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data, even in the initial sample. 
Other researchers have reached an opposite conclusion. In a 2017 study, John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School, found that states that adopted right-to-carry laws saw an increase in violent crime.

By VIVIAN YEEFEB. 18, 2018

A child is shot to death. Maybe at school, maybe at the movies. It is all over TV, all over Twitter, just like the last mass shooting.
Then the cameras go away, and the parents are left in a wilderness of heartbreak. They do not know how to plan a funeral, where to get a therapist. Theyre not aware that scammers will try to fund-raise off their grief, that conspiracy theorists will question their tragedy, or that  hard to believe  they might, eventually, be O.K.
But lots of people do know.
When we had this happen to us, had our daughter slaughtered, we didnt know what to do, or what was going to happen next, said Sandy Phillips, whose 24-year-old daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was one of the 12 killed in the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., in 2012. We didnt want to live. It was horrific. And nobody else understood, except other survivors.
So it is that Ms. Phillips and her husband, Lonnie Phillips, are raising money to travel to Parkland, Fla., where the Phillipses will quietly let the families of 17 of Americas latest victims of mass gun violence  know that they are there to listen, to advise, to hug, to cry, and, perhaps, to recruit them to the ranks of the most committed gun-control activists in the country.
Advertisement
The mass shootings of recent years, the proliferation of grief from rural Oregon to the tip of Florida, have forced hundreds of family members into an unwanted fellowship. Veterans like the Phillipses serve as guides in the immediate aftermath, introducing the bereaved of Sandy Hook to those of San Bernardino and the parents of Virginia Tech to those of Roseburg, in a loose but growing network.
Advertisement
Some mourn in private. Some confront politicians, join gun-control groups and flock to rallies. But whether they turn to advocacy or not, many gravitate toward one another, checking on each other by Facebook or phone whenever another gunman strikes.
In a gun-control debate that often splinters along ideological lines, no one speaks more powerfully than those who survived a high-profile shooting, or the families of those who did not. The power of their testimonials goes beyond their authenticity: They, unlike politicians and advocates, can usually avoid the accusation that they are politicizing a tragedy.
Recognizing the emotional heft of such stories, groups like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence  and Everytown for Gun Safety often make themselves available to survivors and victims families in the aftermath of mass shootings, sometimes even paying for them to travel to meet other survivors and advocates or to attend rallies, hearings and meetings with politicians. Everytown, the group founded and funded by the former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, runs a network of about 1,500 family members and shooting survivors who are trained in activism, including many who were affected not by mass shootings but by the smaller ones that occur daily.
They join a long tradition of families who have turned private heartbreak into public advocacy. There is Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which has successfully shifted public awareness around drunken driving and pushed for tougher laws. There is John Walsh, who became a well-known anti-crime TV personality after his son was kidnapped and killed. There are the parents of people killed by undocumented immigrants, who have seen their campaign against illegal immigration taken up by President Trump.
The difference is that mass-shooting survivors have yet to win any major victories on the federal level. So they do what they can, hoping that when the next mass shooting happens, more people will take to their cause.
The more people that are affected in some way, the more people care; yeah, thats what its going to take, said Jenna Yuille, whose 54-year-old mother, Cindy Yuille, was one of two people shot and killed at the Clackamas Town Center outside Portland, Ore., in December 2012. Its horrible, but thats part of what its going to take.
Ms. Yuilles mother died three days before the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 26 people were killed, 20 of them first graders. The gun-control debate was suddenly everywhere, and Ms. Yuille, encouraged by a friend, began to speak up. She testified in support of background-check legislation in Oregon and got involved with the Everytown Survivor Network. Ms. Yuille now works for Americans for Responsible Solutions, an advocacy group founded by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot outside an Arizona supermarket in 2011, and her husband, the retired astronaut, Capt. Mark E. Kelly.

At an Everytown training event in the spring of 2015, Ms. Yuille met Erica Lafferty, the daughter of one of the Newtown victims, Dawn Hochsprung, Sandy Hooks principal. They were around the same age; their mothers had died three days apart. The connection was instantaneous.
When they heard about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday  Ms. Yuille in a text from her boyfriend, Ms. Lafferty when she glanced at CNN  Ms. Yuille texted Ms. Lafferty to check on her.
They felt the same, they said: Tired.
Is it bad that were feeling so numb? Is it bad that I havent cried? Ms. Lafferty asked Ms. Yuille on Friday, during a joint interview. Because I havent.
Same, said Ms. Yuille, 29. I know there are other people, especially in Oregon, that see me as a leader on this issue, and being a spokesperson on this issue, so I worry about that. I dont want to let people down.
Exactly, said Ms. Lafferty, 32, who works for Everytown. Like, if I slow down, am I going to disappoint anyone? Am I going to disappoint myself?
Many families, of course, do not want to be the faces of anything. They want to struggle in quiet, if not quite in peace. Some of the families of the Newtown victims have never spoken publicly about their ordeal. And some family members, Ms. Phillips said, continue to support gun rights.
Soon after the Sandy Hook shooting, Mark Mattioli, whose son James was killed at the school, testified that legislators should focus on mental health support instead of gun control. He also spoke at a National Rifle Association news conference to praise the groups school safety proposals.
But a large and growing number of families who want gun laws strengthened have chosen to seize the platform the media offers in the wake of a shooting and never to relinquish it. One man who lost his son in the Columbine High School shooting almost two decades ago, Tom Mauser, is still deeply involved in gun-control efforts in Colorado.

People who are affected in a personal way become lifelong dedicated volunteers to this, said Robert Bowers Disney, the vice president for organizing at the Brady Campaign. It just fundamentally changes peoples lives and experiences.
The Phillipses have been to the scene of almost every major shooting since their daughter died, usually letting local authorities and charitable organizations know that they are there if families need them. In Florida, they are planning to offer to connect the families of the teachers killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to the daughter of a teacher killed at Columbine in 1999.

They offer advice on grim matters like psychological treatment (you dont need a grief counselor, they say; you need a trauma therapist) and how to fend off scammers who pretend to raise money for families, only to keep it for themselves.
Increasingly, they have had to warn people about the online trolls who will inevitably inundate them with claims that the shooting was a government hoax.
Some people take months to get in touch. Others, angry, want to talk about activism even before they bury their loved one. One man in Las Vegas who had lost his wife in the country music festival shooting knew no one else in town. So, while he waited for his wifes body to be released, he turned to Lonnie and Sandy Phillips. They are still talking.
One of the first people the Phillipses spoke to after beginning this work was Nicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary.
