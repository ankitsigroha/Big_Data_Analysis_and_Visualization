      "By Tina Rosenberg\n",
      "Ms. Rosenberg is a former editorial writer for The New York Times.\n",
      "A month ago on a college campus in Newburgh, N.Y., an unusual group gathered to talk about gun violence: community leaders, social service providers, the police chief, the district attorney, a staff member of the United States attorney’s office — and 11 of the most dangerous individuals in Newburgh.\n",
      "A few years ago, this town of 30,000 had the highest rates of violent crime and homicide in New York State. The gathering — the seventh since October 2015 — was part of the city’s response: its Group Violence Intervention.\n",
      "The 10 men and one woman had been required to attend by their probation or parole officers. They were nervous. A few had brought along a mother, aunt or uncle. The police chose them because they were members of the gangs or crews most likely to shoot someone, or be shot — usually active gangs in active disputes.\n",
      "Each individual had received a personalized letter signed by the police chief and district attorney, warning of this peril. “We want you safe, alive and out of prison,” the letter said. It then laid out the long prison terms they faced if caught with a gun or committing a gun crime.\n",
      "At the meeting, Police Lt. Joseph Cortez showed slides with photos of men arrested recently in Newburgh, along with the sentences they were serving. “They didn’t take the opportunity to get out of the lifestyle,” he said, urging the people in the room to choose differently. “Now you and your group are going to be getting a lot of scrutiny.”\n",
      "“You can see them really lean forward at that point,” said Isabel Rojas, a former New York City police officer who runs the intervention out of the district attorney’s office.\n",
      "Then Ms. Rojas introduced staff members from the organization Exodus Transitional Community and urged people to call for help with resumes, job training, graduation equivalency diploma preparation, housing — whatever they needed.\n",
      "A pastor, a mother who had lost her son and a formerly incarcerated man spoke about the impact of guns. “Some guys just sit there and look like they’re bored to death,” Ms. Rojas said. “But most, you can tell it’s getting to them. They drop their heads down. That’s the voice of pain, and they’re thinking, ‘I wouldn’t want my mom to go through this.’ ”\n",
      "And then food: wrap sandwiches, salad and brownies. “Something nice,” Ms. Rojas said. “We have it catered. Not pizza.”\n",
      "The March for Our Lives, with its diverse speakers, remembered something that is often overlooked in the national debate over guns: killings by school shooters and terrorists make up less than 3 percent of the nation’s gun homicides.\n",
      "Many people can envision getting in the path of a mass shooter. But few with any influence imagine themselves threatened by everyday urban violence. As has always been true in criminal justice (see most recently: Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La.), the United States values a black life far less than a white one.\n",
      "Florida, for example, just passed a $400 million bill to arm school employees and fund school safety programs, in addition to adopting some small gun-control measures. It contains no money for urban gun violence.\n",
      "Yet a child is statistically safer in school than anywhere else. A school can expect a shooting once every few thousand years. If police officers are moved to schools from other places, safety overall will decrease. (It can also lead to stoking the school-to-prison pipeline through more arrests of children — usually African-American boys — for ordinary acting out.)\n",
      "We do not know how to stop mass shootings. But we do know how to reduce urban gun violence. Strong evidence exists for several programs. Perhaps the best-proven is what Newburgh does, a strategy called focused deterrence.\n",
      "A new paper surveyed 24 studies of focused deterrence initiatives and found “noteworthy crime control” and “solid support for the adoption of such programs by police agencies.” Other studies — reports are available here, here and here — have found the same.\n",
      "Focused deterrence is the opposite of “zero tolerance” policing, which seeks to punish disorder and minor crimes, often with mass arrests, on the theory that disorder sends a message that crime is tolerated.\n",
      "Instead, focused deterrence targets the very worst behavior of the most violent. It doesn’t seek to dismantle gangs — just to keep them from shooting. No mass arrests are necessary to send a message that the community condemns violence. Mothers, pastors and youth leaders tell criminals so, directly.\n",
      "More than 80 cities are using the strategy, which often goes by the name Ceasefire. Many more would use it if they had help and funding. It’s a lot cheaper than hiring more police, but it does require some money, especially to set up. After that, many cities run it with no additional resources.\n",
      "Newburgh could do it because New York State has its Gun-Involved Violence Elimination Initiative, which gives cities with high rates of violent crime money and technical support to use evidence-based programs.\n",
      "But New York is virtually alone, one of only a few states that do this. At the federal level, there have been very few grants for urban gun crime prevention. The administration’s budget for 2019, however, calls for a major increase in money cities might use to fund focused deterrence programs.\n",
      "The father of focused deterrence is David Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City and the leader of the National Network for Safe Communities, which spreads focused deterrence, among other strategies. In 1994, Mr. Kennedy and other academics went to the Boston Police Department and asked to start a working group to combat youth homicide. Two years later, Operation Ceasefire made its debut there and produced an immediate and sustained drop in youth homicide and shootings, unlike that of any other American city.\n",
      "“Ceasefire recognized that homicide and gun violence overwhelmingly are driven by a very small network of very high-risk people,” Mr. Kennedy said. “It’s not about dangerous neighborhoods full of bad people. The community wants to be safe and hates violence.”\n",
      "Antonio Cediel, an educator and community organizer, runs urban anti-violence programs at the PICO Network, a national organization of faith-based groups. PICO is helping a dozen cities start Ceasefire-type programs. Mr. Cediel said that in his home city of Oakland, Calif., with 420,000 people, “between 250 and 350 people are responsible for a majority of the shootings.” And at any moment only about 50 to 100 are responsible — depending on which disputes and grievances are running hot.\n",
      "Late in March, two gangs in Newburgh had a run-in, during which shots were fired and a man in a car ran over two people. (Nobody died.) “There was going to be some major retaliation,” Lt. Cortez said. He and Ms. Rojas spent Monday visiting the homes of individuals likely to be involved.\n",
      "In what is called a custom notification, they knocked on the door and asked to see the individual. “If someone doesn’t want to talk to us, we talk to a sister or brother or mother,” Ms. Rojas said. The message is the same as in the call-in: If you retaliate, a long prison sentence awaits. We want you alive, safe and free. Here’s the number to call, 24/7, to get any kind of help you need.\n",
      "“We visited nine guys, and eight ended up calling for help,” Ms. Rojas said. “Some people say, ‘Don’t knock on my door again.’ But 90 percent of the time, people are welcoming. It’s heartbreaking to hear from family, ‘I don’t know what else to do. This is a blessing.’ ”\n",
      "In Pittsburgh homicides hit a 12-year low in 2017; the mayor credited Ceasefire.\n",
      "Detroit’s homicide rate hit a 50-year low in 2017. Its police chief, James Craig, said in an interview that the city had started Ceasefire in two high-crime precincts in 2015 and has gradually expanded it. “I wasn’t much of a believer when I first got to Detroit,” he said. “But what we have in place now is probably one of the better-working Ceasefire models. It has had a profound impact on sustaining violent crime reduction.”\n",
      "In Newburgh, statistics in a voluminous New York State report show shootings are way down (See pdf, page 1202) — from 55 victims in 2015 to 17 last year. Violent crime, especially firearm crime, has plummeted.\n",
      "In 2012, the year Oakland began its current version of Ceasefire, it was the third-most dangerous American city, with 126 murders. Last year it had 74. In 2017, Oakland had  277 nonfatal shootings — down from 557 in 2012.\n",
      "Many cities are on their second or third try at Ceasefire. In Boston, it perished of its own success: After its leaders became celebrities and left the city, the homicide rate went back up.\n",
      "In the past, Oakland, Newburgh and Pittsburgh had all used Ceasefire, but abandoned it when it didn’t lower violent crime.\n",
      "Why didn’t it work then? For Ceasefire to be effective, a city needs to do a lot of things well. But cities sometimes concentrate only on law enforcement — the easiest part, because it’s business as usual.\n",
      "David Muhammad, a community organizer who worked on Ceasefire in Oakland — he now trains people in the practice with the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform — said that Oakland’s earlier attempts were disorganized, unfocused and too reliant on law enforcement. He and others said that it’s succeeding now because the city uses better data, a full-time administrator and top-level social services.\n",
      "Reygan Cunningham, who runs the new Ceasefire Oakland, points out that the services predated Ceasefire and are open to everyone. “The difference is that they’re now tailored to people at the very highest risk of violence,” she said.\n",
      "Perhaps most important, though, is the involvement of local people from high-crime neighborhoods. Mr. Cediel credits the community groups with bringing Ceasefire back to Oakland. “They filled up one of the biggest churches in the city and had the mayor and police chief and D.A. at the front with cameras and made them commit to doing it, publicly,” he said.\n",
      "Mr. Muhammad said that Oakland focuses on the message that the community condemns violence. The police play only a minor role in call-ins. Community members handle the custom notifications.\n",
      "“The moral voice of the community is way more powerful than the police,” Mr. Kennedy said. When he trains police officers, he often asks if they were afraid of the police when they were growing up. A few people raise their hands. “Then we ask: Who was afraid of your mother? Everybody raises his hand.”\n",

      "The comedy of cruelty is rarely funnier or more brutal than when it comes from Armando Iannucci, a virtuoso of political evisceration. A comic talent who should be household famous, he is best known for “Veep,” the HBO series about Washington politics that was a satire when it first hit in 2012 but now seems like a reality show. He also directed the movie “In the Loop,” an aptly obscene burlesque about the run-up to the Iraq War. He only seems to have abandoned contemporary politics in his latest, “The Death of Stalin,” an eccentric comic shocker about a strong man and his world of ashes and blood.\n",
      "The laughs come in jolts and waves in “The Death of Stalin,” delivered in a brilliantly arranged mix of savage one-liners, lacerating dialogue and perfectly timed slapstick that wouldn’t be out of place in a Three Stooges bit. Turning horror into comedy is nothing new, but Mr. Iannucci’s unwavering embrace of these seemingly discordant genres as twin principles is bracing. In “The Death of Stalin,” fear is so overwhelming, so deeply embedded in everyday life that it distorts ordinary expression, utterances, gestures and bodies. It has turned faces into masks (alternately tragic and comic), people into caricatures, death into a punch line.\n",
      "The movie opens in early March 1953. The iron-fisted Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin), 74, has ruled the Soviet Union for decades and racked up countless crimes against humanity and millions of victims. A near-monosyllabic thug with a helmet of steel-gray hair and a retinue of flatterers — Khrushchev and Molotov are among the names crowding this familiar roll call — Stalin likes classical music and old westerns, a casual reminder that barbarism and civilization are often partners in crime. Squirreled away in a dacha, a relatively modest woodland retreat at a remove from the Kremlin, Stalin kicks back with his toadies only to fall grievously ill later that same evening.\n",
      "A preview of the film.\n",
      "He briefly hangs on, gasping but mute, throwing his nominal comrades in arms into a fast-spiraling panic. The most appealing, or rather the least obviously terrible, of these is Khrushchev (a superb Steve Buscemi), the minister of agriculture and a cunning, outwardly drab schemer. Like a seasoned standup, Khrushchev tells his wife which of his jokes made Stalin laugh, an accounting that she dutifully preserves for future reference. When he learns that Stalin has taken ill, Khrushchev hastily pulls a jacket and pants over his pajamas and rushes to his side, where Beria (Simon Russell Beale, brilliant), the head of the secret police, the N.K.V.D., has already taken up position and begun plotting.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“The Death of Stalin” is based on graphic novels by Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin, and Mr. Nury shares writing credit here with Mr. Iannucci, David Schneider, Ian Martin and Peter Fellows. It’s a seamless effort that comes alive with a dazzling ensemble that includes Jason Isaacs as Zhukov, a preening military force, and Michael Palin as Molotov, a first deputy prime minister. When the story opens, Molotov has no inkling that he’s about to make a miraculous escape. Like the rest of Stalin’s men, he has helped create a world of bureaucratically administered terror, one in which each bullet to the head is rationalized on a neatly typed hit list. And now he’s on such a list.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Mr. Iannucci draws from history with its competing narratives, bending it to his purposes. Real traumas and outrages are mentioned in passing, rather than dutifully explained; there’s a brief look inside the gulag, for instance, with its desperate prisoners and splatters of blood. For the most part, though, the Stalin-era atrocities are the ghastly background for the frantic intrigue of his hangers on. Khrushchev soon emerges as one of the canniest of these survivors, though Beria moves faster and initially with far more lethal force. Soon after Stalin finally dies, Beria sends out his own kill list, embracing — as Selina Meyer of “Veep” once put it — continuity with change.\n",
      "The action shifts to Moscow and assorted gruesome and grandiose interiors in which Khrushchev and the rest take turns organizing the funeral and their own uncertain futures. Karl Marx increasingly gives way to the Marx Brothers as Stalin’s son and daughter (the contrapuntal Rupert Friend and Andrea Riseborough) rush in to wail and thunder, adding absurdity and self-dramatizing melodrama to the mix. There are secret meetings, crowds of mourners, visiting dignitaries and more secret meetings. Mr. Iannucci is particularly good at the theater of sycophancy and at all the ways in which supplicating faces, hands and bodies can quiver in fear and with a terrible love.\n",
      "“The Death of Stalin” is by turns entertaining and unsettling, with laughs that morph into gasps and uneasy gasps that erupt into queasy, choking laughs. Mr. Iannucci’s decision to have the performers speak in an array of accented English — from Brooklyn to Cockney — carries some political resonance, suggesting that totalitarianism knows no borders. But it also makes the familiar strange, creating a Brechtian alienation that few movies succeed in pulling off. Mr. Buscemi plays Khrushchev with persuasive realism, and he certainly looks the part, with his bald head and boxy clothing. But the character’s Brooklyn accent also underscores Mr. Buscemi’s identity, making him present, too.\n",
      "This doubling in which both the actor and the character wave at the audience is also a familiar comic strategy, one used by the likes of Bugs Bunny and Jim Carrey. It fits for a movie in which almost all the characters have been playing variations on the same role of slavishly adoring, lethally submissive servant. Stalin hasn’t taken his final breath before Beria and Khrushchev stop playing those roles; others, like Molotov and Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor), the deputy prime minister and Stalin’s heir apparent, scarcely seem to have anything left except their long-enacted performances.\n",
      "In his book “The Last Days of Stalin,” Joshua Rubenstein captures the dictator’s power over the Soviet Union in a quote: “Stalin was inside everyone, like the hammer alongside the sickle in every mind.” In Mr. Iannucci’s movie, you see the hammer and the sickle in each pale, scheming face, in every prison cell and bootlicker’s smile. It’s in Beria’s every move and there when Malenkov puts on a dolorous face and a corset, setting the timer for his own end. There are times when Mr. Iannucci seems as merciless as he is funny; hope can seem very distant here. Yet he also suggests — with the help of a pianist played by Olga Kurylenko and the example of his movie — that art is one sure path to resistance.\n",

      "To this day, gun rights advocates dispute the study’s findings. The N.R.A. pushed Congress in 1995 to stop the C.D.C. from spending taxpayer money on research that advocated gun control. Congress then passed the Dickey Amendment in 1996, and cut funding that effectively ended the C.D.C.’s study of gun violence as a public health issue.\n",
      "The result is that 22 years and more than 600,000 gunshot victims later, much of the federal government has largely abandoned efforts to learn why people shoot one another, or themselves, and what can be done to prevent gun violence.\n",
      "After the Parkland school massacre in Florida last month, lawmakers and gun control experts have demanded that the agency take up the issue of studying gun violence again, arguing that the federal law doesn’t ban such research altogether but prohibits advocacy of gun control.\n",
      "Alex M. Azar II, the secretary for health and human services, said at a congressional hearing that he believed the C.D.C. should resume the work. “We’re in the science business and the evidence-generating business,” Mr. Azar said, ”and so I will have our agency certainly working in this field, as they do across the broad spectrum of disease control and prevention.’’\n",
      "At a meeting with reporters last week, Mr. Azar said that other priorities, like fighting the flu and Ebola, also competed for funds. He did not specify which subjects would be a priority, how much money he might ask Congress to allocate to gun violence research, or whether he will transfer money from other health agency programs.\n",
      "There is no shortage of ideas — or criticism of the time lost in studying gun violence.\n",
      "“We have repeatedly and consciously turned our back on the problem,” said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine who in July started the Firearm Violence Research Center at the University of California, Davis, with funding from the state. “How many thousands of people are dead today who might have been alive if that research effort had been put in place and we had answered critical questions and set prevention measures in motion?”\n",
      "It’s a question that haunts researchers. In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, President Obama directed the C.D.C. to reconsider gun violence research. The agency commissioned a report from the Institute of Medicine outlining priorities, but never followed up.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The most pressing questions cited by the institute, now known as the National Academy of Medicine, still have no answers. Who is most likely to use a gun in a crime, and where does the gun come from? How often are guns used in domestic violence cases? How often are the people who are arrested for gun crimes the same individuals who actually bought the weapons?\n",
      "Then there is a separate set of questions about what kind of policy changes or prevention efforts actually reduce gun-related deaths and injuries.\n",
      "Andrew R. Morral, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, directed a recent study  that found moderate evidence that background checks do reduce both firearm suicides and homicides. The report also said there is moderate evidence that stand-your-ground laws, which allow people to use guns to defend themselves without first trying to retreat, may increase the murder rate.\n",
      "“In many cases, we’ve been having arguments about factual matters for decades,” Mr. Morral said. As an example, he cited laws that seek to prevent children from killing themselves or others with guns.\n",
      "“The N.R.A. has argued that such laws make it tough for people to defend themselves in a crisis,” Mr. Morral said. “But there’s no research on that. We’ve argued and argued and argued, and we have not invested in the research needed to answer the question: What is the trade-off between childhood deaths and self-defense?’’\n",
      "The new set of proposals by President Trump calls for a commission to examine whether to raise the age to 21 from 18 for young people to buy certain firearms. Just after the Parkland killings, Mr. Trump repeatedly supported raising the age, but the latest proposals do not include such a measure — one that the N.R.A. opposes.\n",
      "Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who was director of the C.D.C. from 2009 to 2017, said in an email that he believed the study of firearms-related violence was important even though little was conducted during his tenure.\n",
      "“That’s why year after year I asked Congress to fund C.D.C. to do research in this area,” Dr. Frieden said. ”We need to know which interventions are most effective and how they can best be implemented to save the most lives.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But Congress refused to include funding for those proposals, he said. The National Institutes of Health has continued to fund some gun violence research, including violent crimes related to drug and alcohol consumption, and parental roles in preventing injury from firearms.\n",

      "N.I.H. is also assessing ways to reduce suicides and accidental deaths among children and adolescents and war veterans. More than 60 percent of all gun deaths in the United States are suicides.\n",
      "The Justice Department also studies gun violence, but the budget for that research is a small fraction of what the federal government spends on looking at other high-mortality hazards, like car accidents or smoking — money that has led to actions that greatly reduced deaths in both categories.\n",
      "Private foundations have stepped up to fill the gap. But there is another congressional roadblock that private money cannot circumvent — the Tiahrt Amendments, which prevent the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from sharing its firearms-tracking database with anyone outside of law enforcement.\n",
      "Those records, Mr. Morral and other experts say, are crucial to analyze the flow of guns used in crimes over state borders, from places where guns are easy to buy to places where it is tougher.\n",
      "The Dickey Amendment technically did not ban gun research, only advocacy. Its real goal — one it easily achieved, according to public health officials in place at the time — was to scare federal agencies into thinking twice about even collecting data that might reflect badly on gun ownership.\n",
      "Since the Parkland murders, there have been signs of change. Several Republican lawmakers said they would support the C.D.C. taking on the issue.\n",
      "“There’s a tremendous misunderstanding here and maybe an overabundance of caution on the part of C.D.C. and N.I.H.,” said Representative Tom Cole, of Oklahoma, chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for the health and human services department.\n",
      "In an interview, Mr. Cole also said he expected there would be money available for such work at both N.I.H. and C.D.C., but not until next year’s appropriations.\n",

      "Some Democrats are pressing to take advantage of the new mood on Capitol Hill. Senator Patty Murray, of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the health committee, and Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, have both pressed Mr. Azar for details, but as of Friday neither had received a response.\n",
      "“From fighting cancer to decreasing road traffic fatalities, public health research has played a critical role in saving lives,” Ms. Murray wrote to Mr. Azar. ‘‘It is immoral and unacceptable to treat gun violence any differently.”\n",
      "In the House of Representatives, Democratic members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce have called for a hearing on the adequacy of federal research into gun violence.\n",
      "Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A., said the group continues to support the Dickey Amendment. “We oppose taxpayer dollars being spent to advocate for gun control,” Ms. Baker said.\n",
      "Asked if there is any type of research the group would support, she said the N.R.A. would like to see a study of how often firearms are used in self-defense.\n",
      "The Institute of Medicine report, published with the National Research Council, is still considered a road map by the C.D.C. The report proposed research on issues like motivations for gun ownership and use; the relationship between poverty and gun use; risk factors that lead youths to carry guns; and dozens of other questions.\n",
      "The C.D.C. did ask for and receive money to expand its National Violent Death Reporting System, which tracks homicides and suicides in 40 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The project aims to help state health departments develop strategies to reduce violent deaths, but some critics say the database lacks sufficient detail to be very useful.\n",
      "Research proponents want to make sure that new studies don’t serve as an excuse for a lack of action on gun control.\n",
      "“Although more gun research is needed,” Dr. Frieden said, “there are proven means to reduce gun violence, including better background checks, getting guns away from domestic abusers and people convicted of violent crimes, and safe storage. More research can help. But this is no excuse for inaction.”\n",

      "From the moment Woody Harrelson swaggers into “LBJ,” you can see the glinting intelligence and hear the thudding heartbeat that he brings to the title character. It couldn’t have been easy. He’s nearly entombed in facial makeup that obscures his own physiognomy — an actor’s landscape — while bringing to life Lyndon B. Johnson, a transitional, still-contentious figure of fascinating contradictions. This was, history tells us, a politician who early in his career spoke against civil rights legislation yet signed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, a president who declared an “unconditional war” on poverty at home even as he escalated the war in Vietnam.\n",
      "A preview of the film.\n",
      "Only some of that history makes it into this disappointing movie, which tracks Johnson’s road from the Senate to the vice presidency and then the presidency, an ascension that culminates with him assuming the role of the nation’s healer after John F. Kennedy’s death. It’s a near-miraculous, compressed coming into consciousness (the movie runs 98 minutes) that develops through different time frames and neatly dovetailing scenes that suggest history is plotted by that great filmmaker in the sky. One moment it’s 1960 and Johnson is weighing his chances as the next Democratic presidential nominee; the next, he is struggling to find a place in the Kennedy administration and vainly looking for political love in the Oval Office.\n",
      "Mr. Harrelson makes Johnson an almost predictably entertaining force, and his performance fills the movie with oxygen whether he’s barnstorming through politics, slamming down phones, lobbing obscenities, braying at his staff from a toilet seat or gleefully grabbing his crotch while announcing that his tailor needs to make his pants roomier. He’s fun to watch despite the facial makeup, which is so distractingly exaggerated that when I wasn’t thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire I was flashing on the rubbery presidential masks worn by the bank robbers in “Point Break.” It’s a wonder that Mr. Harrelson can convey any emotion through all that latexy blubber much less keep drawing you closer to him. I recognized the similarly encumbered Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays Lady Bird, only when she started talking.\n",
      "Directed by Rob Reiner from Joey Hartstone’s script, “LBJ” is a frustratingly underdeveloped vehicle for Mr. Harrelson’s talents as well as an unfortunate missed opportunity. Mr. Harrelson hits his beats with charismatic menace and a reverberant Texas twang, but he’s booming in a vacuum. Part of the problem is the filmmakers never figure out why this particular story needed to be told at this specific moment; it feels at once dutiful and arbitrary. That’s too bad, especially given that it could have continued a story told through Obama-era movies — “Selma,” “Jackie,” “Marshall” — that, both directly and obliquely, speak to the present through the convulsions of the 1960s.\n",
      "Taken together, these movies create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a profoundly changing nation using black, female and marginal characters who once would have remained behind while the white hero went off to write history. They represent, onscreen and off, the very changes that they narrate. With its armies of pale men and next to no black characters, “LBJ” doesn’t look all that different from most other great-man stories. Yet there are moments — Johnson conspiring with a racist power broker played by an excellent Richard Jenkins — when the filmmakers seem ready to shake up the story by laying white, male power bare in all its ugliness. In scenes like these, the movie inches around complexity even as it continues to clear the way for another make-believe savior.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Sprinkled amid the throngs of young people protesting gun violence in Washington on Saturday were groups of students without signs denouncing President Trump, or the National Rifle Association, or the shooting massacres that have plagued the nation.\n",
      "Instead, they carried megaphones and wore T-shirts calling attention to something close and constant: urban gun violence.\n",
      "In cities such as Baltimore, the anguish of shootings feels different — the bloodshed comes not in isolated bursts of mass slaughter, but instead in a ceaseless rhythm, something that happens to friends and family, classmates and neighbors, in front yards and on playgrounds.\n",
      "“In the inner city, there’s a game: gunshots or firecrackers?” said Steve Sias, a high school student at Baltimore City College who came to the Washington march. “Whenever you hear the sound, you ask everyone in the house: Is it gunshots or firecrackers? Usually the parents say firecrackers so they don’t startle the kids. But more times than not it’s actually gunshots in the distance, or right outside your window.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Last year, Baltimore set a per capita record for homicides: 343 total, or about 56 for every 100,000 people. The city’s population is just over 600,000. Its murder rate was by far the highest among the nation’s 30 largest cities.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Students from Baltimore, as well as young people who attended a rally in Chicago, were vocal on Saturday about the need for steps to reduce gun violence, much in the same way as students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people last month. But they had a different idea of the problem.\n",
      "Destini Philpot, another student at Baltimore City College, was joined on Saturday in Washington by Carrie Zaremba, a student at the Friends School of Baltimore, a predominantly white Quaker institution. The two said they had helped organize a citywide walkout this month that involved both public and private schools.\n",
      "“It shouldn’t take a mass shooting in a predominantly white area like Parkland to start caring about gun violence,” Ms. Zaremba said.\n",
      "Ms. Philpot said that many of those at the rally were thinking of gun violence in the only way they knew how: as mass shootings.\n",
      "Ke’Shon Newman’s brother was shot nine times on Chicago’s South Side, where gun violence is a daily threat. Now, Ke’Shon is heading to Washington to march with high school students from Parkland, Fla.\n",
      "“When they talk about gun violence, they’re talking about schools,” she said.\n",
      "Private donors paid for 60 buses that carried around 3,000 Baltimore students to the Washington event. Some Baltimore organizers skipped their city’s satellite march to attend the one in the capital, hoping to reach an audience largely unfamiliar with the kind of violence that visits them with gruesome regularity.\n",
      "One of those organizers, Erricka Bridgeford, has helped work on a campaign called Baltimore Ceasefire, which holds quarterly “cease-fire” weekends that call for a stop to killings for a three-day period.\n",
      "On Saturday, she recalled what had brought her to Washington: the lasting agony from losing her brother, stepson and friends to gun violence.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“I’ve seen dead bodies and blood,” she said. “These are things you never recover from. You learn how to live your life differently, because the air looks different once you experience that kind of trauma. I have to do something with the pain. I don’t want to be a prisoner to it.”\n",
      "Ms. Bridgeford said shootings were a never-ending feature of life in her Baltimore neighborhood.\n",
      "“There’s no such thing as post-traumatic stress in a lot of communities in America, because there’s no ‘post,’” she said. “You don’t get a chance to experience the aftermath before there’s another trauma because of gun violence.”\n",
      "One of the students walking with Ms. Bridgeford was Shanika Walker, who attends the Excel Academy at Francis M. Wood High School in Baltimore, which recently lost seven students to homicide in 15 months.\n",

      "Speaker after speaker at the Chicago rally mentioned relatives or classmates who had been wounded or killed in shootings, frustrated that past calls to action had not led to change.\n",
      "“Chicago has been plagued with gun violence way before the Parkland shooting,” said Juan Reyes, a high school student. “Suddenly, people are talking about students not feeling safe in schools. But in reality, students in our city’s South and West Sides have never felt safe.”\n",

      "One high school student, Denzel Russell, told the crowd, “I have watched one of my friends get murdered while we were playing on the basketball court. That experience had me frozen and speechless.”\n",

      "Emerson Toomey, 17, who helped organize the Chicago march, said her mother was grazed by a bullet in a drive-by shooting on the North Side of the city.\n",

      "But for the teachers who believe they must now think as much about school shootings as they do about urban gun violence, Saturday’s rallies in Washington and Chicago felt like the meeting of two threats, now inseparable.\n",
      "“I see the look on the students’ faces,” said Jeremy McConnell, a special education teacher at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Baltimore. “They come from these communities. They come from these families that engage in this kind of violence. They might be a sibling or neighbor removed.”\n",
      "“They know gun violence is real. They see it in the streets,” added Mr. McConnell, who, as the voice behind public address announcements at the school, reminds students to be vigilant after news of shootings in Baltimore and across the country. “But they haven’t seen it in school. They think any day now it’s coming here.”\n",

      "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n",
      "The Library of Congress writes, “The meaning of this sentence is not self-evident, and has given rise to much commentary but relatively few Supreme Court decisions.”\n",

      "Excerpt 1: In “John Paul Stevens: Repeal the Second Amendment,” John Paul Stevens, a retired associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, writes:\n",
      "Rarely in my lifetime have I seen the type of civic engagement schoolchildren and their supporters demonstrated in Washington and other major cities throughout the country this past Saturday. These demonstrations demand our respect. They reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society.\n",
      "That support is a clear sign to lawmakers to enact legislation prohibiting civilian ownership of semiautomatic weapons, increasing the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 years old, and establishing more comprehensive background checks on all purchasers of firearms. But the demonstrators should seek more effective and more lasting reform. They should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment.\n",

      "Excerpt 2: In “After the March, Follow This Gun Reform Battle Plan,” Steve Israel, a Democratic representative from Long Island from 2001 to 2017, writes:\n",
      "It has been 38 days since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.; 174 days since the shooting at a concert in Las Vegas; 1,011 days since the killings at a church in Charleston, S.C.; and 1,926 since the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Ten days ago, students organized a nationwide school walkout to demonstrate their outrage about these and other shootings.\n",
      "On Saturday they plan to amass in Washington to pressure a Congress that has done nothing meaningful to protect American children in classrooms, movie theaters, churches, malls — because, thanks to the National Rifle Association, many of their elected representatives are too busy protecting their re-election.\n",
      "My advice to the students? When you finish marching on the mall, march into the specific congressional districts where you can actually make a difference.\n",
      "He continues:\n",
      "You can stage marches and school walkouts, but then walk into the swing congressional districts that matter. In the end it’s not about standing up to be heard. It’s about changing who sits in Congress.\n",
      "_________\n",
      "Excerpt 3: In “Stop Shielding Gun Makers,” Brad S. Karp, the chairman of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, and H. Christopher Boehning, a partner there, write:\n",
      "Senator Charles Schumer has proposed three measures to reduce gun violence: expanded background checks, protective orders to disarm individuals at risk of violence or self-harm, and an assault weapons ban. These proposals are critically important. But there is another effective response that has been largely ignored: repeal of a law that prevents suits against the gun industry.\n",
      "A bedrock principle of the American legal system is accountability for wrongdoing. Businesses that cause harm may be held legally responsible in a court of law. Through the imposition of financial liability, our legal system encourages businesses to reduce harm to consumers by making their products safer and disclosing the risks associated with their use.\n",
      "Thanks in part to the accountability imposed by lawsuits, society knows more about the dangers of smoking, and tobacco companies market their products more responsibly. Automakers continually develop and install new safety features, and these innovations deliver results: From 1975 to 2016, the rate of motor vehicle deaths decreased by nearly half. While motor vehicle deaths have declined over the last two decades, firearm deaths have not: According to the most recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people now die from firearms than motor vehicle accidents.\n",
      "_________\n",
      "Excerpt 4: In “Why Gun Culture Is So Strong in Rural America,” Robert Leonard, the news director for the radio stations KNIA and KRLS, writes:\n",
      "It’s been many years since I hunted squirrels and rabbits with my Grandpa Leonard. I grew up around guns and remember the pride I had when I completed my N.R.A.-sponsored gun safety training in Boy Scouts, back when the N.R.A. was a group primarily known for teaching gun appreciation and safety rather than lobbying.\n",
      "I have come to understand and appreciate arguments for more gun control. But guns are important to the culture in my conservative community in Iowa, and people around here reject most gun control legislation. So I do my best to understand where they are coming from.\n",
      "One morning after the mass shootings in Parkland, Fla., I spoke about them with a police-officer friend. He has led active-shooter trainings in our schools. He believes that better background checks might help prevent some gun violence, and that people need to do a better job securing their firearms (especially from suicidal teenagers).\n",
      "But he doesn’t believe that significant gun control measures will ever meet approval in rural America, including a ban on AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles. He confided that many conservative police officers do not want more gun control and that other officers have told him that should they ever have to start taking guns away from people, they will quit their jobs. Like most rural conservatives, he truly believes that taking guns away from law-abiding citizens will never solve America’s gun problems, including mass shootings. He says gun control has never stopped criminals from getting guns, and never will.\n",

      "Good morning on this cloud-shrouded Wednesday.\n",
      "This morning, instead of attending his usual seminar on United States government, Andrew Myers will address those in power.\n",
      "Mr. Myers, a senior at the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights, is one of tens of thousands of students nationwide who will walk out of classrooms today to protest gun violence, following the killing of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., a month ago.\n",
      "Roughly 1,000 Brooklyn students are expected to rally in solidarity today at Borough Hall, according to Mr. Myers, one of the event’s organizers. Dozens of schools in all five boroughs have registered to take part in walkouts as well.\n",
      "Most of the students involved are too young to vote. Until he turned 18 in January, Mr. Myers was one of them — an impetus for his civic engagement. “This is our only outlet,” he said. “We can’t do anything other than protest.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "New York City schools have been relatively safe; the fatal stabbing at a Bronx high school in September was the first killing inside a city school building in more than two decades. Even so, students here inevitably feel the fear and uncertainty that follow school shootings.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Since February, though, a wave of student activism has taken hold, led by the survivors of the Parkland shooting. In rallies, news media appearances and town hall-style events, they have demanded action from elected officials — and that, too, has spread to New York.\n",
      "“Politicians have absolutely failed us,” Mr. Myers said, “and we’re marching today to let them know that we’re here, that we care about this issue, that we’re the next voting bloc that’ll be out there in the midterm elections.”\n",
      "He added, “Politicians are bringing up the same talking points they always bring up — mental health, violent video games and student safety — which are all relevant topics, but they all ignore the root of the problem: guns.”\n",
      "The school has been supportive of the student-led effort and faculty members who decide to march, Mr. Myers said.\n",
      "The Department of Education has also released guidelines for walkouts around the city:\n",
      "• Middle and high schools will not prevent students from participating.\n",
      "• Students engaging in peaceful protest will not be arrested, but those putting people or property in danger may be disciplined accordingly.\n",
      "• Leaving for 17 minutes — to honor the 17 Parkland victims — will be treated as cutting class, not an absence.\n",
      "At Packer Collegiate Institute, Mr. Myers said, “they just want us back in school by 1:15.”\n",
      "Here’s what else is happening:\n",
      "Meh.\n",

      "Released without fanfare or publicity screenings, the haunted-house movie “Winchester” would seem to lack the confidence of its makers. One soon sees why: Despite the typically elevating presence of Helen Mirren, this super-silly feature (the fifth from the Australian brothers Peter and Michael Spierig) stubbornly resists being classed up.\n",
      "A preview of the film.\n",
      "Set in 1906 and inspired by actual events (liberally sauced with myth and legend), the story centers on the eccentric Sarah Winchester (Ms. Mirren, grimly determined), heiress to the rifle fortune and eager dabbler in architecture and spiritualism. Believing that she has flourished on the deaths caused by her late husband’s invention, Sarah atones by constructing a vast and ever-changing mansion, whose hundreds of rooms are intended to imprison evil spirits or encourage benign ones to move on.\n",
      "Enter Dr. Price (Jason Clarke), a psychologist hired by the Winchester company’s board to count Sarah’s marbles and report back. Conveniently addicted to laudanum, Dr. Price is soon staggering around the labyrinthine structure, besieged by generic scares: a creepy butler, a rattling armoire, a child in the grip of milky-eyed possession. The Hogwarts-like domicile might be swarming with staff and construction workers, but not until Price arrives do the spirits hit the fan.\n",
      "Written by the Spierigs and Tom Vaughan, the script is as batty and clichéd as its heroine. The house (you can take a tour of the real one in San Jose, Calif.) never feels like a single space, as ho-hum apparitions appear and disappear without a trace. Ms. Mirren and her representatives are probably hoping the movie will do likewise.\n",

      "HONG KONG — A newspaper controlled by the Communist Party of China criticized the United States for its high level of gun violence, calling it hypocritical that a country that condemns others over human rights violations is failing to stem such slaughter at home.\n",
      "The opinion column in The Global Times, which is run by the Communist Party’s People’s Daily Group, said that after a gunman killed 17 people last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the United States should look to China, which has strict controls on guns.\n",
      "“It’s inhumane for the U.S., which boasts about its human rights record, to turn a blind eye to gun violence, snub increasing calls for gun control and risk more innocent lives,” the piece said.\n",
      "The column on guns appeared Friday in the English-language edition of the newspaper, but not in the Chinese print version. While The Global Times is controlled by the Communist Party, it is not an authoritative voice, meaning its pugnacious opinion pieces don’t necessarily reflect the views of the Chinese government in the way a commentary in The People’s Daily would.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Still, the view that guns are a human rights issue in the United States is regularly stated by official sources in China. China’s annual report on human rights in the United States, which it issues in response to the State Department’s reports on China’s human rights situation, usually mentions gun violence.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“In 2016, the U.S. government exercised no effective control over guns, law enforcement departments abused their power, and crimes were not effectively contained,” said the most recent report on human rights in the United States from China’s State Council Information Office. “As a result, civil rights, especially the right to life, were seriously threatened and people’s personal rights were continuously infringed upon.”\n",
      "The Global Times regularly covers gun violence in the United States, publishing a commentary after the deadly shootings at a church in Texas in November and a lengthy analysis after the Orlando, Fla., nightclub killings in 2016.\n",

      "“Gun ownership in China is strictly regulated, which helps reduce gun-related crimes and deaths,” the latest commentary said. “The U.S. should learn from China and genuinely protect human rights.”\n",
      "While China has tight controls on firearms and gun crimes are rare, shootings with illegal firearms do sometimes happen. Knives are the most common weapon used in attacks, leaving unarmed people better able to defend themselves. On Feb. 11 a man with a knife attacked shoppers at a Beijing mall, killing one person and injuring 12 others. Some shoppers and one security guard were seen fending of the assailant with stools and chairs.\n",
      "Terrorist attacks on civilians have sometimes been carried out in China by groups armed with knives, including an attack on a train station in Kunming that killed 31 people in 2014.\n",
      "The killings at Stoneman Douglas High School occurred just as China prepared to celebrate the Lunar New Year, and as a result weren’t widely covered or discussed by the Chinese news media. Some Chinese outlets, including the overseas edition of The People’s Daily, did make note of the death of Peter Wang, a Chinese-American student who was credited with holding open a door to help students flee as the attacker fired.\n",
      "Mr. Wang, 15, was born in Brooklyn and spent some of his childhood in China, friends and family told The Miami Herald. He was a Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps cadet who dreamed of one day attending the United States Military Academy at West Point. The academy issued him a ceremonial letter of acceptance, saying his actions showed commitment to “duty, honor and country.”\n",

      "When a gunman killed 20 first graders and six adults with an assault rifle at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, it rattled Newtown, Conn., and reverberated across the world. Since then, there have been at least 239 school shootings nationwide. In those episodes, 438 people were shot, 138 of whom were killed.\n",

      "The military-style weapon has also been the gun of choice in several other mass shootings: at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.; at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.; at a holiday party for county health workers in San Bernardino, Calif.; and at the campus of Umpqua Community College in Oregon.\n",
      "But the National Rifle Association has taken to calling the AR-15 “America’s rifle.” Though the federal government does not keep track of exactly how many AR-15s are in circulation, experts estimate that there are easily several million in the nation’s rifle racks and gun safes — a huge number, given that the gun, along with other so-called assault weapons, was banned under federal law from 1994 to 2004.\n",
      "Read the full story here. \n",
      "A vast majority of guns used in 18 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check. At least nine gunmen had criminal histories or documented mental health problems that did not prevent them from obtaining their weapons.\n",

But there are a handful of policies that could reduce the likelihood of such events, or reduce the number of people killed when such shootings do occur. And several of them have strong public support.\n",

      "A heavily armed young man is accused of killing 17 people after opening fire on terrified students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday. It was the third mass shooting in the past four months in the United States. \n",
      "Nikolas Cruz, who has been linked to a history of mental illness, is believed to have used a legally obtained AR-15 in the shooting. The attack has led to widespread conversations about links between gun violence and mental illness, and how lawmakers and interest groups are debating potential policy responses. Below is a look at some facts and falsehoods uttered by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin; Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont; and others in the wake of Wednesday’s shooting. \n",
      "Mr. Ryan’s claim reflects a common misconception. According to various polls, roughly half of Americans either believe that failing to identify people with mental health problems is the primary cause of gun violence or that addressing mental health issues would be a major deterrent. \n",
      "That conclusion is not shared by experts or widely accepted research. \n",
      "In an analysis of 235 mass killings, many of which were carried out with firearms, 22 percent of the perpetrators could be considered mentally ill.\n",
      "Overall, mass shootings by people with serious mental illness represent 1 percent of all gun homicides each year, according to the book “Gun Violence and Mental Illness” published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2016. \n",
      "To be sure, gun violence experts contacted by New York Times reporters have said that barring sales to people who are deemed dangerous by mental health providers could help prevent mass shootings. But the experts said several more measures — including banning assault weapons and barring sales to convicted violent criminals — more effective. \n",
      "And, as The Times has reported, Americans do not appear to have more mental health problems than other developed nations of a comparable size, which experience far fewer mass shootings. \n",
      "Some further research: \n",
      "A 2016 academic study estimated that just 4 percent of violence is associated with serious mental illness alone. “Evidence is clear that the large majority of people with mental disorders do not engage in violence against others, and that most violent behavior is due to factors other than mental illness,” the study concluded. \n",
      "A 2015 study found that less than 5 percent of gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were committed by people diagnosed with mental illness. \n",
      "As John T. Monahan, a professor specializing in psychology and law at the University of Virginia, told The Times:\n",
      "“Two things typically happen in the wake of a mass shooting. First, politicians claim that mental illness is the major cause of violence in America. Then, advocates for people with mental illness respond by denying there is any relationship whatsoever between mental illness and violence. Both groups are wrong. Research shows that the association between mental illness and violence is not strong, but it does exist.”\n",
      "The figure is drawn from a list maintained by the advocacy group Every Town for Gun Safety. As the group explains on its site, the total includes “any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds.”\n",
      "As The Washington Post, The Washington Examiner and other outlets have pointed out, that includes some incidents that most people would not consider school shootings. For example, the list includes suicides, like a Florida man who shot himself in the parking lot of a school while it was closed. And it also includes accidents like a Minnesota third-grader who pulled the trigger on a police officer’s holstered weapon, injuring no one. \n",
      "Israeli officials and experts rejected this version of events after a similar claim was made by Wayne LaPierre, the president of the National Rifle Association, after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 20 children and six adults were killed. \n",
      "“Israel had a whole lot of school shootings until they did one thing. They said, ‘We’re going to stop it,’ and they put armed security in every school, and they have not had a problem since then,” Mr. LaPierre said in December 2012 on NBC. \n",
      "Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told The New York Daily News at the time that the situations in the United States and Israel were “fundamentally different” and said that the measures that Israel enacted were a response to terrorism.\n",
      "“What removed the danger was not the armed guards, but an overall antiterror policy and antiterror operations, which brought street terrorism down to nearly zero over a number of years,” Mr. Palmor said. \n",
      "After Mr. Trump focused on mental health in his national address on Thursday in response to the Parkland shooting, many journalists, activists and others, like Mr. Kimmel, noted the repeal of a rule that would have prevented “seriously mentally ill” people from purchasing guns. \n",
      "Federal law already bars anyone who “has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution” from purchasing a gun. And a majority of states have laws requiring them to report mental health information to the national background check system. But gaps in the system still exist. \n",
      "After the Newtown shooting, President Obama proposed adding another data source to the background check system: reports from the Social Security Administration of people who receive disability benefits through a third party because of mental impairments. According to a 2016 White House fact sheet, the rule would have affected 75,000 people. \n",
      "It was opposed by the National Rifle Association, but also the American Civil Liberties Union, which said the rule violated civil rights. Some disability rights groups also argued against the rule on the basis that it perpetuated stigmas about mental illness. \n",
      "Mr. Trump signed a congressional resolution that expressed disapproval of the proposed rule in February 2017, nine months before compliance would have been required. \n",

      "It started out last month as a writing exercise on the 1963 Birmingham Children’s Crusade, when more than 1,000 students skipped school and marched to demand civil rights.

      "“Sorry don’t get it done.” With that line, the likable, easygoing western “The Ballad of Lefty Brown” tips its battered cowboy hat to its genre influences. John Wayne delivers that same admonition in “Rio Bravo,” Howard Hawks’s 1959 masterpiece about a sheriff and a ragtag group holding off a powerful, autocratic rancher. (Wayne’s sheriff is chiding his alcoholic deputy, played by Dean Martin.) In large and small ways, that film and other classics from the western canon inform “Lefty Brown,” which opens one dark, stormy night in the Montana territory in 1889, the year it became the 41st state.\n",
      "A preview of the film.\n",
      "One of the foundational themes of the western is the making of America, an origin story that plays out in tales about frontiers, borders, wagon trains, settlements, railroads, towns, cowboys and Indians. Invariably, these are narratives of violent transformations in which land becomes property and some people become citizens while others remain outlaws or are turned into permanent exiles. In “Lefty Brown,” those changes have already affected a Montana rancher, Edward Johnson (Peter Fonda), who has recently been elected a senator and is headed east. He’s a classic type, the outsider as insider who, as he tells his wife, Laura (Kathy Baker), is “going to take on all of Washington.”\n",
      "Some 10 minutes into the film, though, a villain fatally derails Edward’s plans, spurring the story forward and igniting its slow-burning mystery. Laura accuses Edward’s longtime hand, Lefty (Bill Pullman), of failing her husband. (“You were supposed to watch his back,” a grieving Laura tells an apologetic, equally bereft Lefty. “Sorry don’t get it done.”) Lefty sets off to find Edward’s killer, a quest that becomes a journey and leads him straight into trouble. He soon meets an inexpert traveler, Jeremiah (Diego Josef), who has killed his own horse. All Jeremiah knows of the West are the romantic myths that he has learned from tattered dime novels, some of which feature fictionalized tales right out of Lefty’s past.\n",
      "The writer-director Jared Moshé takes his time in “Lefty Brown,” which meanders here and there for close to two hours, ranging over picturesque, Big Sky landscapes while rambling deeper into prickly narrative complications. If there isn’t much urgency it’s partly because Lefty has been rather too closely modeled on the irascible if endearing coots played by the likes of Walter Brennan. Often grizzled comic relief, though sometimes tragic, these sidemen stand in the long, tall shadow of the hero, giving him grief while always following his lead. They’re loyal dogs, surrogate nannies, maybe close pals. They’re types that need more to carry a movie than Mr. Moshé has given Lefty.\n",
      "Like Brennan’s character, Stumpy, in “Rio Bravo,” Lefty has a noticeable limp and the pitch of his voice periodically slides to lightly comedic heights. (You can hear a bit of Slim Pickens’s warble, too.) At times, Lefty seems like the sum of his inspirations, which remains true even as the film progresses and settles into its groove. Central to the movie’s modest pleasures is how it engages with screen history; at the same time, as the too familiar story of good men and bad, loyalty and betrayal emerges, these allusions can remind you that you’re not watching Howard Hawks. Instead, Jim Caviezel and Tommy Flanagan ride up, and the plot continues to thicken amid firing guns.\n",
      "Mr. Pullman, his good looks obscured by chiaroscuro shadows and mutton chops, keeps you tethered to Lefty even when the rambling turns to drift. Mr. Moshé knows his genre. There’s beauty in his panoramas and charm in his reflexive gestures, typified by Jeremiah’s love for the mythic heroism that foreshadows his and Lefty’s future. Yet self-consciousness is also a hallmark of this genre; Douglas Fairbanks’s would-be cowboy reads dime novels in the 1917 film “Wild and Woolly.” Even so, while Mr. Moshé’s ambitions can be frustratingly modest, he does know that — however fraudulent the genre’s myths — the image of a man riding a horse into the sunset is in our cinematic DNA.\n",

      "Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control.\n",
      "Watch the video above. What are your reactions to what these students of Stoneman Douglas High School share?\n",
      "In “A ‘Mass Shooting Generation’ Cries Out for Change,” Audra D. S. Burch, Patricia Mazzei and Jack Healy write:\n",
      "This is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it.\n",
      "Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 people this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices — in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman — are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting.\n",
      "… At other high schools across the country, students rallied in solidarity with Stoneman Douglas High and staged walkouts to protest what they called Washington’s inaction in protecting students and teachers. A gun control advocacy group, Moms Demand Action, said it had been so overwhelmed with requests from students that it was setting up a parallel, student focused advocacy group.\n",
      "“People say it’s too early to talk about it,” Mr. Kasky said. “If you ask me, it’s way too late.”\n",
      "His argument reflects the words of other students who want action: The issue is not an abstraction to them. These are their murdered friends, their bloodstained schools, their upended lives.\n",
      "Students said they did not want to cede the discussion over their lives to politicians and adult activists.\n",
      "“We need to take it into our hands,” Mr. Kasky said.\n",

Then the class assignment mushroomed into a plan — hatched by 10- and 11-year-olds — to stage a little civil disobedience of their own.\n",
      "So on Wednesday morning, the students in Craig Sampsell’s fifth-grade class at Case Elementary School in Akron, Ohio, will pick up posters they drew and walk out of their classrooms, joining many thousands of other students in a nationwide protest against gun violence after the killing of 17 people in a Florida high school last month.\n",
      "Asked whether that was an appropriate age to be protesting about a disturbing event, the principal, Danjile Henderson, said: “My fifth-grade students were very aware of the details of the events and wanted to have their own peaceful protest.”\n",
      "Still, she drew lines around who could participate and how. Third through fifth graders may walk out; second graders can observe, but not walk; kindergartners and first-grade students will remain in class for discussions on school safety in general that avoid the shooting itself. “Not all parents may want that detailed conversation on what happened in Florida,” Ms. Henderson said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "With some parents wanting their children to get firsthand exposure to a nationwide political demonstration; others worried that the protests are stoking the fears of young children about a threat that remains uncommon; and still others objecting to the gun-control message entirely, one question has been weighing heavily on school administrators this past week: How young is too young for children to join the walkout?\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Many districts and schools that are tolerating, if not encouraging, participation in what organizers call the National School Walkout are also calibrating their approach for their youngest students. In New York City, middle and high school students may walk out of class with approval from a parent, such as with a permission slip, but elementary school students cannot leave unless a parent or guardian comes to check them out.\n",
      "At Woods Cross Elementary School in Woods Cross, Utah, students will be allowed to leave class at 10 a.m. and go to the gym for 17 minutes, the same starting time and duration (one minute for every victim in Parkland, Fla.) as other walkouts around the country. Parents may also check them out of the school during that time, and they will not be penalized.\n",
      "“We’re giving them an opportunity to express their First Amendment rights in a safe place,” said Rachel Peterson, a physical education teacher at the school who is also safety commissioner for the state board of the Utah PTA.\n",
      "In suburban Nashville, David L. Snowden, director of schools for the Franklin Special School District, sent an email to families saying that the district had decided that it would not be appropriate for students in its elementary schools, which run through fourth grade, to participate in the walkout, but that students in grades five and up could join.\n",
      "In an interview, Dr. Snowden said he was not concerned that very young children would be frightened by the walkout, only that they would not understand what it was about. “Sometimes I think when you’re teaching children, especially younger children, you try to take into consideration, will there be a full understanding of what they’re doing and why they’re doing it,” he said. “Just to walk out of class for 17 minutes, I’m not sure what that is really teaching.”\n",
      "Even within Akron’s 50-school district, agendas for Wednesday differed markedly from school to school. At Firestone Park Elementary, students were expected to read a poem about peace. At Pfeiffer Elementary, students would be reviewing safety procedures. And at Robinson Community Learning Center there were no plans at all — students had not expressed an interest, according to the district.\n",
      "Elise Cappella, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at New York University’s Steinhardt School, said there was a difference between what the youngest students — from kindergarten to second grade — and older children could understand. While not advocating any particular stance, she said: “Schools could make the decision that kids in kindergarten through second grade are not provided the opportunity to walk out. They are cognitively, socially, emotionally younger. They may feel more fear about it and less understanding.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Children in the third grade and up, she said, will be more likely to be exposed to news and hear their parents talking about it. “They are reaching a point where having something that’s potentially positive and productive to do that makes them feel a sense of agency and safety could be a good thing,” she said.\n",
      "Ms. Cappella said that whether elementary schools decided to participate in the protest or not, the goal should be to project a sense of community to their students. “And if you can create that space,” she said, “whether that’s in the classroom or in the hallways or in the schoolyard or out at a protest or a march, that’s the most beneficial space for young kids to be in.”\n",

      "Some school districts are trying to discourage any type of school walkout, regardless of age, warning that any student who participates will be marked as absent from class or even disciplined.\n",
      "In Sayreville, N.J., where students have been threatened with suspension if they walk out, the president of the school board, Kevin Ciak, said at a meeting last month that “if we decide that we open this door, we open this door to allow students to basically walk out and protest anything.”\n",
      "Barbara P. Canavan, the schools superintendent in Harford County, Md., said that a walkout “presents, paradoxically, a threat to student safety, as word of the walkout has been widely disseminated and students who go outside could become more vulnerable.”\n",
      "Instead, Ms. Canavan said, her district would offer “a learning module that will provide students with an opportunity to share their feelings about recent events across the nation and will allow them to speak about solutions in a structured way.”\n",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, which has offered training to students planning to participate in the walkouts, said that districts can discipline students under attendance guidelines.\n",
      "“But what they can’t do,” the A.C.L.U. wrote in a guide for student protesters, “is discipline you more harshly because of the political nature of or the message behind your action.”\n",
      "Even some schools where demonstrations are being allowed are being careful about the tone.\n",
      "Ms. Peterson, of Woods Cross in Utah, said that there was no program planned for the assembly — the students would be able to express themselves as long as they were not rowdy or disruptive. “We are teachers and not necessarily there to make a political statement in that time,” she said. “Whatever is decided by students in that time and space, we will allow it to happen as long as it is peaceable and respectful.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "If some students who stayed behind expressed surprise or bafflement at their classmates leaving the room, she said, teachers would use their own tact and judgment about how to explain it. “The way I would word it is that some kids are walking out to show support for lessening school violence, in honor of the people in Florida,” Ms. Peterson said.\n",
      "But in Alexandria, Va., when one school decided that fifth graders could join the walkout if their parents signed them out, a parent lodged her own form of protest.\n",
      "\n",
      "            This is being organized by groups that want to ban all guns and are demanding congress act. Kids shouldn’t be used as props.        \n",
      "“My elementary school has 5-year-olds in it,” the parent, Julie Gunlock, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Independent Women’s Forum, said in an interview. “Some of my friends, their kids are much younger than a fifth grader. And it’s frightening to them.”\n",
      "Maeva Lile, 11, one of the fifth-grade organizers at Case Elementary in Akron, said that most of her friends were aware of the gun-control debate and thought that AR-15s, the powerful rifle used in Parkland and other mass shootings, should not be legal. But she said her class did not want to debate the Second Amendment, and so its posters will simply honor the students killed in Parkland with their names.\n",
      "Still, she thought it was time for children to do something. “Adults have been protesting against things,” she said on Monday, “but nothing has changed that much.”\n",

      "It is not just in Florida where the mass shooting at a high school is prompting lawmakers to take up gun control legislation. The same thing is happening across the country, from Washington to Vermont.\n",
      "What was one of the deadliest school shootings in modern American history prompted Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island to sign an executive order on Monday to establish a policy to take guns away from people who pose a danger to themselves or others.\n",
      "“If the federal government won’t act, states need to do more to prevent the gun violence that has become far too common,” Ms. Raimondo, a Democrat, said in signing the measure.\n",
      "Many of these measures to address gun violence come as students around the nation, accustomed to inaction in Congress, have begun protesting. The most vocal have been the survivors of the shooting, which left 17 dead in Florida on Feb. 14.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Still, not all states are moving to toughen gun laws. Some states are considering action to loosen regulations. Here is a roundup of what states are considering doing or have already done.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Governor Raimondo’s move by executive order was the first of its kind. Five other states — Connecticut, California, Washington, Oregon and Indiana — have passed similar “extreme risk” laws, sometimes known as “red flag” laws, having done so either in the legislature or by voter referendum. Since the Florida shooting, a dozen others are considering similar measures.\n",
      "Rhode Island has also joined with Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York in a coalition to combat gun violence. The group plans to create a multistate database to trace and intercept guns used in crimes or transported across state lines.\n",
      "Lawmakers have proposed a  package of gun measures that defy the powerful National Rifle Association, but fall well short of the more restrictive measures, like an assault weapons ban, favored by the shooting’s survivors.\n",
      "Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, proposed raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles to 21 and called for a raft of measures he said could keep mentally ill or violent people from purchasing weapons and keep schools safer. Republicans in the House and Senate, who appear supportive of Mr. Scott’s proposals, also called for a three-day waiting period on the purchase of those weapons, which already exists for those who wish to buy handguns.\n",
      "Mr. Scott proposed $450 million in new funding for school security and $50 million in mental health funding and called for a law enforcement officer to be posted in every public school.\n",
      "Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, has done an about-face in his rural state, where hunting is a major pastime and which has some of the most lax gun laws in the country. Even after the shooting, he told the Vermont publication Seven Days that he saw no need for changing laws. “I believe our gun laws are balanced,” said Mr. Scott, who has a 93 percent rating from the N.R.A.\n",
      "But shortly after, a student at a Vermont high school was accused of planning a  mass shooting. Mr. Scott said he was “jolted” by the prospect of such a disaster so close to home.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“The reality of how close we came to a devastating tragedy underscores the threat of violence that faces the entire country,” he said. “As a result, I’ve been asking myself, ‘Are we doing everything we can to protect our kids?’”\n",
      "Now, he said, “Everything should be on the table at this point.”\n",
      "The State Senate is expected to pass two measures this week to tighten gun controls. The Senate Judiciary Committee last week unanimously passed one bill — to allow law enforcement to remove guns from people considered at extreme risk of harming themselves or others.\n",
      "The committee was divided on the second, more controversial bill — an expansion of background checks — but in an unusual step, appeared ready to allow it to move to the Senate floor without a committee vote. The State House is likely to take up the two measures later next month.\n",
      "The day after the shooting, Oregon’s House passed a bill making it illegal for people convicted of domestic violence or those with restraining orders against them to possess weapons, even if they are not married to, do not live with, or do not have children with their victims.\n",
      "One of the three Republicans who joined Democrats in voting for the bill said pressure from groups like the N.R.A. made him want to “crawl under my desk in the fetal position,” according to The Oregonian. The State Senate passed the bill late last week; Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, is expected to sign it.\n",
      "“It took the voices and outrage of youth devastated by gun violence to hold decision makers’ feet to the fire,” she said in a statement.\n",
      "A bill filed in Washington State on Friday would raise the minimum age to purchase a semiautomatic rifle or shotgun with “tactical features” to 21, which the bill’s sponsors said would align rules to buy those guns with existing rules for handguns. It would also make the sale of those weapons subject to state and federal background checks.\n",
      "The bill would also create a program to allow students to report threats or potentially violent activity anonymously to the attorney general’s office and would require the state to give grants to school districts for emergency response systems.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Lawmakers in Washington are also working on a ban on bump stocks, which accelerate the rate of fire on semiautomatic firearms. The legislation passed the Senate in January and the House on Friday, with a final Senate vote remaining.\n",
      "Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, has appointed a committee to propose concrete actions and urged it to make its recommendations quickly.\n",
      "Meanwhile, several bills, some restricting access to guns and some expanding it, are pending in the Statehouse.\n",

      "Michael J. Madigan, the House speaker, said he would schedule votes this week on two gun-related bills that were filed before the shooting. One would require gun dealers to be licensed, much like car dealerships or beauty salons. The other, similar to the “extreme risk” laws in other states, allows a judge to bar a person from possessing weapons if family members or law enforcement officers ask the court to do so.\n",
      "Mr. Madigan said lawmakers this week would also introduce legislation to raise the minimum age to purchase military-style assault rifles to 21.\n",
      "Some bills loosening gun restrictions have advanced in the state since the Florida shooting, according to The Indianapolis Star. A Senate committee last week advanced a bill that would do away with a $125 fee for a lifetime license to carry a handgun, and would increase from four years to five years a permit that exempts holders from background checks when purchasing a handgun.\n",
      "In the House, a committee passed a bill last week allowing people to carry weapons at churches that share property with schools, as long as they are working for or attending the church, and the church does not prohibit weapons. This month, before the shooting, the measure was passed by the full Senate.\n",
      "The state is considering legislation to lower the age at which people can carry hidden, loaded guns in public to 18 from 21, while also requiring anyone under 21 to get a permit, including for carrying their weapons on college campuses. The State House passed the measure earlier this month. It is now before the State Senate.\n",
      "The House has passed a measure that the N.R.A. calls “self-defense” legislation. It would let people carry guns on the grounds of schools or churches. The Senate is considering a bill to repeal the permitting process to allow law-abiding citizens to carry a weapon without having to get a concealed-carry permit.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "After the shooting, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, sent a letter to Mike Morath, the Texas Education Agency commissioner, ordering safety information to be distributed to all schools, and asking him to take steps to ensure that all schools have completed safety audits and that all have a multihazard emergency plan in place.\n",

      "With each mass shooting, calls rise from gun control advocates for tighter rules on firearms. The go-to policy prescription involves background checks. But a measure passed by the House and being considered in the Senate to expand the National Instant Criminal Background Check System would not only fail to fix major flaws in the system but would also probably introduce new ones.\n",
      "Lawmakers from both parties acknowledge that errors in the background check system let felons obtain guns, as we saw when a deranged man, Devin Kelley, killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., in November. The killer, while in the Air Force, had been convicted of domestic violence in 2012, involuntarily committed to a mental health care center and given a bad conduct discharge. Yet the Air Force failed to follow policies to ensure that his conviction was reported to federal law enforcement, which allowed the killer to pass the check. The military has failed to report other such cases.\n",
      "The background check measures before Congress aim to improve enforcement of existing law and increase such reporting by imposing financial penalties on government officials whose agencies fail to provide required information. That’s a good goal, but any proposal should also fix another major problem with the background check system: false positives that stop law-abiding people from getting weapons that they might need to protect themselves and their families.\n",
      "The background check system confuses the names of law-abiding individuals with those of criminals, resulting in thousands of “false positives” every year. Relying on phonetically similar names along with birth dates just doesn’t allow for much accuracy.\n",
      "Ronnie Coleman, a Virginia resident, was not allowed to buy a gun in 2012 because another person from his hometown in Texas who had a felony conviction also had a name and birth date “close enough” to his to cause a denial. Mr. Coleman was advised to get a unique transaction number from the background system to prevent this confusion in the future, adding another bureaucratic step to the process.\n",
      "Between 2006 to 2010, the last period for which more comprehensive annual data  on the denial of firearm applications by the background check system are available, there were 377,283 denials. But the federal government prosecuted only 460 of those cases, leading to 209 convictions, mostly on charges of providing false information. There was a similarly small number of state prosecutions resulting from the gun purchase denials.\n",
      "Why didn’t more of those denials lead to perjury prosecutions? According to my analysis, the reason is simple: a high percentage of cases are dropped because the applicant was wrongly denied clearance to buy a gun.\n",
      "Many of those people are trying to buy guns to protect themselves. “This incredibly high rate of false positives imposes a real burden on the most vulnerable people,” said Reagan Dunn, the first national coordinator for Project Safe Neighborhoods, a Justice Department program started in 2001 to ensure gun laws are enforced.\n",
      "The system also does a poor job of accounting for people who have had their rights to buy a firearm taken away and then restored. In the 1990s, Frank Wise of Jacksonville Beach, Fla., was convicted of check fraud after his employer went bankrupt. When his paycheck bounced, two checks he sent to his mortgage company also bounced. Nearly 20 years later, Mr. Wise was able to get his record cleared, but that information wasn’t entered into the background check system for three years. Getting this fixed cost him $3,600 in legal fees.\n",
      "Even more people would face such problems if background checks were made “universal,” meaning to include the private sale or transfer of firearms, which are exempt from checks in most states. Many people consider this a common-sense policy, but there would be a cost: Background checks involve fees that drive up the price of guns in private sales and make it harder for poor people to defend themselves.\n",
      "To get some idea of what background checks add to the price of a weapon, look at the fees for checks on private transfers in states that already impose checks. In New York City and Washington, those fees cost at least $125 for private gun sales.\n",
      "If people believe that background checks reduce crime and benefit everyone, everyone should pay for it, out of general government revenue. Pushing background checks on private transfers as proposed during the hearing disarms many law-abiding poor people.\n",
      "So what should be done when the background check system fails to stop mass killers from attacking? One answer is to have more civilians carry permitted concealed handguns. Those law-abiding gun owners can help protect places where there are no police. In 2013, PoliceOne, a news and resource site for active and retired law enforcement officers, released a survey finding that over 91 percent of the more than 15,000 “verified law enforcement professionals” who responded supported concealed carry.\n",
      "We do need to fix the background check system. But let’s really fix it. Let’s make sure that rare cases like Devin Kelley can’t slip through the cracks, but let’s also make sure that the government stops preventing millions of law-abiding citizens from buying guns for protection. Adding more names without fixing these problems will only disarm law-abiding Americans.\n",

      "A month ago, hundreds of teenagers ran for their lives from the hallways and classrooms of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and staff had been shot to death.\n",
      "On Wednesday, driven by the conviction that they should never have to run from guns again, they walked.\n",
      "So did their peers. In New York City, in Chicago, in Atlanta and Santa Monica; at Columbine High School and in Newtown, Conn.; and in many more cities and towns, students left school by the hundreds and the thousands at 10 a.m., sometimes in defiance of school authorities, who seemed divided and even flummoxed about how to handle their emptying classrooms.\n",
      "The first major coordinated action of the student-led movement for gun control marshaled the same elements that had defined it ever since the Parkland shooting: eloquent young voices, equipped with symbolism and social media savvy, riding a resolve as yet untouched by cynicism.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“We have grown up watching more tragedies occur and continuously asking: Why?” said Kaylee Tyner, a 16-year-old junior at Columbine High School outside Denver, where 13 people were killed in 1999, inaugurating, in the public consciousness, the era of school shootings. “Why does this keep happening?”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Even after a year of near continuous protesting — for women, for the environment, for immigrants and more — the emergence of people not even old enough to drive as a political force has been particularly arresting, unsettling a gun control debate that had seemed impervious to other factors.\n",
      "In Florida, where students from Stoneman Douglas High and other schools had rallied in the state capital, the governor signed a bill last week that raised the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21 and extended the waiting period to three days.\n",
      "On a national level, the students have not had the same impact. This week, President Trump abandoned gun control proposals that the Republican-led Congress had never even inched toward supporting.\n",
      "But, for one day at least, the students commanded the country’s airwaves, Twitter feeds and Snapchat stories.\n",
      "Principals and superintendents seemed disinclined to stop them. Some were outright supportive, though others warned that students would face disciplinary consequences for leaving school. At many schools, teachers and parents joined in.\n",
      "Wreathed in symbolism, the walkouts generally lasted for 17 minutes, one for each of the Parkland victims. Two more nationwide protests are set to take place on March 24 and on April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine shooting.\n",
      "On a soccer field burned yellow by the Colorado sun, Ms. Tyner stood alongside hundreds of her fellow students, who waved signs — “This is our future,” one said — and released red, white and blue balloons.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Yet in many places, for many students, Wednesday was just Wednesday, and class went on. Even at Columbine, the embrace of the gun control movement was not universal.\n",
      "“People say it’s all about gun control, it’s all about, ‘We should ban guns,’” said Caleb Conrad, 16, a junior, who stayed in class. “But that’s not the real issue here. The real issue is the people who are doing it.”\n",
      "In the one-school rural community of Potosi, Wis., no student group had organized a protest. After a handful of students expressed some interest, the school decided to hold an assembly at 10 a.m. to talk about school safety measures and the value of being kind to one another.\n",
      "At 10 a.m., one student, a female freshman, left the building alone.\n",
      "Throughout the assembly, she sat by herself outside, by a flagpole, for 17 minutes. She appeared to be praying, said the principal, Mike Uppena, adding that she was not in trouble for leaving.\n",
      "Officials in Lafayette Parish, La., initially said that students could participate in the day’s events, believing that it was appropriate to honor the Florida victims.

      "By Antonio Cediel, Amber Goodwin, Michael Mcbride and Ciera Walker\n",
      "In the wake of this week’s devastation in Las Vegas, it is important to remember that this kind of headline-grabbing mass shooting constitutes only a tiny fraction of the gun murders in our country. There were over 8,000 gunshot homicides in 2014, according to the F.B.I.’s most recent calculations, and gun violence is the first and second leading cause of death for African-American and Latino males between ages 15 and 34.\n",
      "Many have thrown up their hands in despair over these numbers, but the good news is that proven strategies to protect people from being murdered by firearms do exist. The bad news: They’re tragically underutilized, for reasons that we suspect have to do with a dismissive national attitude toward the areas where most acts of violence are committed.\n",
      "In the 1990s, a highly effective gun violence reduction strategy was developed in Boston by a group including law enforcement officers, researchers, and black clergy members. According to the National Institute of Justice, it resulted in a 63 percent reduction in the average monthly number of youth homicide victims in that city, an accomplishment that was called “the Boston Miracle.”\n",
      "Since then, variations of that strategy have been implemented in cities across the country. For example, according to a study by the Campbell Collaboration, a nonprofit organization that evaluates the effects of this type of intervention, Stockton, Calif., saw a 42 percent reduction in its monthly count of gun homicides in the first year of the strategy’s implementation; similarly, Oakland, Calif., saw just under a 30 percent reduction. (In 2017, the city is on track to have its second-lowest homicide rate in over 30 years.)\n",
      "While movies, television and news outlets often give the impression that entire cities and neighborhoods are filled with thugs, criminals and killers, the reality is that those responsible for a majority of shootings represent a tiny percentage of the residents of any given city. In response to this fact, effective gun violence reduction strategies adopt a highly targeted, data-based approach in which the small number of individuals most at risk for shooting (and being shot) are provided with individualized programs of support and pressure to lay down their guns. To this end, law enforcement officials, clergy members, community leaders, social service providers and mentors who have themselves escaped violent lifestyles work in partnership with one another to help these individuals turn their lives around.\n",
      "Part of the beauty of this approach is that unlike tactics such as “stop and frisk” policing, these strategies do not eat away at already fractured relationships between law enforcement and communities of color. Instead, they harness the leadership and experience of the people who live in and understand these communities. Unlike the national gun violence prevention policy efforts, which tend to be led by progressive white groups and individuals, they ensure that those who are directly affected — mostly people of color — decide how peacemaking and anti-violence initiatives are carried out.\n",
      "Given the positive results, many astutely ask why these approaches have not been implemented more widely. The central answer is that the high death tolls in urban communities of color have proved to be socially and politically acceptable to mainstream America. For some reason, while mass shootings like the one we saw in Las Vegas are widely seen as symptomatic of a “national” problem, the continuing scourge of killings in our cities isn’t. The result is that neither Democratic nor Republican Justice Departments have funded these types of violence reduction strategies on a large scale.\n",
      "Absent a targeted investment strategy from the federal government, some local communities have taken on the challenge for themselves. In most cases, this has been made possible through relatively small reallocations of city or county funds. Police departments in urban areas often account for large percentages of city budgets but end up spending more time and resources trying to solve murders rather than working to prevent them. The RAND Corporation estimates that a single murder costs the community over $8 million in court, police, hospital, incarceration and other expenditures. Even the most fiscally conservative among us can agree that a $1 million to $2 million investment at the city or county level would more than pay for itself with even minimal homicide decreases.\n",
      "But even in cases in which cities have re-prioritized their funding and seen significant decreases in homicides, the strategy has been vulnerable to changing political winds. A new police chief, a new mayor or even the infighting of community-based organizations can disrupt the fragile political equilibrium that supports the work. So, what we have found is that focused and relentless community organizing is vital to helping ensure that the most vulnerable communities are able to demand the most effective strategies for keeping their neighborhoods safe — regardless of who is in office. To that end, we work with the clergy, youth, parents of murdered sons and daughters, police departments and government officials in cities and counties around the country to ensure that effective, lifesaving strategies are in place.\n",
      "It would be one thing if the solution to gun violence in our country were as elusive as the cure for cancer. But that’s not the case. The effective solutions exist and are simply not being funded or supported. While the left and the right continue to argue about gun control and gun rights, it would be refreshing to see some bipartisan support at the federal, state and local levels for programs that can get results right now, because in cities across our country, gun murders every bit as tragic as the ones that took place in Las Vegas are happening every day.\n",

      "“True to the Game” presents a Philadelphia parable. Gena (Erica Peeples) is an aspiring writer, Quadir (Columbus Short) is a cocaine kingpin. Their love promises a new beginning, but there may be no way to exit a life on the streets. Based on the Teri Woods novel of the same name, the hustlers of “True to the Game” are trapped in a world of twists and treachery. But though Ms. Woods’s novel was a resonant entry in the crime genre when it came out nearly 20 years ago, this adaptation lacks the vision to find a fresh angle on her story. It’s all too easy to guess which characters will be marked for tragedy and which characters will learn from their loss.\n",
      "In the best circumstances, the familiarity of the crime genre can provide an opportunity for a filmmaker to flex their point of view, but the direction, by Preston A. Whitmore II, seems hampered by either a lack of resources or a lack of interest. The camera lingers on expensive cars, but club scenes appear threadbare. Quadir and his rivals are supposedly the toughest high rollers in the game, but their virility is primarily conveyed through their conspicuously manicured beards. Among the actors, Vivica A. Fox commands a cameo appearance with an authority and charisma that outweighs any of the movie’s leads — including Mr. Short’s Quadir. And Nelsan Ellis, in one of his last film roles, is underutilized as Quadir’s cutthroat second-in-command. To its detriment, “True to the Game” tries to reform kingpins before it maximizes on its own investments.\n",

      "Politics is the art of the possible, and Bret Stephens’s suggestion of repeal is not possible. However, it may be possible to replace the Second Amendment in a way that clarifies both the right of Americans to own guns and the powers of the government to regulate that right. It could read as follows:\n",
      "“The right of individuals to keep and bear arms consistent with the purpose of self-defense shall not be infringed. Congress and the states shall have the power to regulate the possession, ownership, sale, production and transportation of arms and ammunition, provided that such regulations do not infringe the right of individuals to keep and bear arms consistent with the purpose of self-defense.”\n",
      "Advocates of gun control would support this amendment because it clarifies that the government has authority to regulate gun ownership. Advocates of gun owners’ rights might support the amendment because it enshrines their right to own guns for self-defense.\n",

      "Bret Stephens asserts that the National Rifle Association has donated a “paltry” $3,533,294 to all current members of Congress since 1998, citing a chart published in The Washington Post. But that chart counts only direct contributions, and therefore does not include money that the N.R.A. has spent on behalf of specific candidates.\n",

      "Mr. Stephens is correct that the N.R.A.’s influence is not limited to the money it spends on behalf of politicians. But he’s wrong to suggest that the N.R.A.’s political spending is “paltry” — and that it doesn’t make a difference. It does.\n",

      "Every so often in “The Dark Tower,” you catch a glimpse of what might have been: the might-have-been narrative ambition, the might-have-been pop mythology, the might-have-been genre assemblage. Based — loosely seems altogether too generous a word — on the Stephen King series, the movie is an unappealing hash of moviemaking clichés that, after much scurrying and blathering, devolves into a generic shoot’em-up. About the only thing holding it together is Idris Elba, whose irrepressible magnetism and man-of-stone solidity anchors this mess but can’t redeem it.\n",
      "Mr. Elba plays the otherworldly Roland, whose name suggests the Arthurian legend with knights and so forth. Onscreen, though, Roland basically points, shoots and serves as an overqualified babysitter for Jake (Tom Taylor), a 14-year-old with psychic powers (he “shines” à la “The Shining”) who lives here and now on what Roland calls Keystone Earth. Roland, by contrast, lives in Mid-World, an incoherent realm of foggy woods, digital boogeymen, cinematic allusions, slavering nods to Mr. King’s voluminous oeuvre and some geological formations that may cause you to uselessly flash on images from John Ford westerns. (The movie was partly shot in the Cederberg Mountains in South Africa.)\n",
      "For reasons that emerge in expository blurts, Jake and Roland travel between Mid-World and the considerably less interesting Keystone Earth. Also on the move is Walter, a.k.a. the man in black (Matthew McConaughey), an amusingly dissolute supervillain who, with weary hand waves and insinuating whispers, oozes about like a Vegas lounge lizard — with a hint of the Wicked Witch of the West snap – lording over heavily armed, face-changing, blood-lusting snarlers (Jackie Earle Haley, et. al). Mr. McConaughey, topped by an artfully arranged shock of black hair and flashing some tanned chest that makes you want to whip out the gold chains, has truly developed into a Zen master of sleaze.\n",
      "The title refers to a mysteriously woo-woo, sky-piercingly tall spire that somehow holds both the universe’s various worlds and its monstrous threats in check. Walter wants to destroy the dark tower; Roland intends to protect it. Jake, who tends to look as confused as the audience may feel, doesn’t yet have a mission, though giving this twerp a purpose — a kind of wee hero’s journey (“Surrender, Jake”!) — seems to be the endgame. It’s a default solution, and reads like a cop-out. After all, if Stephen King hands you a complex fiction that turns pulpy tropes into a dense mythology with its own language and heavyweight heroes like Roland, wouldn’t you run with at least some of it?\n",
      "The “Dark Tower” series can be traced to Mr. King’s love of, among other inspirations, J. R. R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings” novels as well as Sergio Leone’s masterly 1966 film “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,” which I suppose explains the duster Roland wears and an empty nod to spaghetti westerns. So, there’s that. Mostly, there are clotted action scenes, gun fetishism, bad writing and stop-and-go rhythms that suggest a longer version may once have existed. The director, Nikolaj Arcel, shares screenwriting credit and blame with Akiva Goldsman, Jeff Pinkner and Anders Thomas Jensen; whatever they thought they were doing here remains as mysterious as Walter’s hair product.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday that the Justice Department was proposing to ban so-called bump stocks through regulations rather than wait for Congress to act, a move that defies recommendations by federal law enforcement officials and could subject the department to litigation from gun rights groups.\n",
      "Mr. Sessions’s announcement came moments after President Trump said on Twitter that the Justice Department would imminently announce a rule banning bump stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "            Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.        \n",
      "It also comes amid rising public pressure on Washington to curb gun violence after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead last month. Students will gather Saturday in Washington to protest gun violence for an event called March for Our Lives.\n",
      "The Justice Department’s proposed rule “would define ‘machine gun’ to include bump-stock-type devices under federal law — effectively banning them,” Mr. Sessions said in a statement.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The proposed bump stock ban would defy the conclusion of Justice Department officials who have said that they could not, under existing law, stop the sales of bump stocks, accessories that allow semiautomatic guns to mimic automatic fire, and that congressional action was needed to ban them. But Mr. Sessions said the department had worked around those concerns.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“After the senseless attack in Las Vegas,” Mr. Sessions said, “this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.”\n",
      "The 55-page proposal, which was published for public comment, said it was redefining machine guns to include bump stocks because “such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.”\n",
      "The proposal would force bump stock owners to surrender or destroy them the day the rule would go into effect.\n",

      "“When you pull the trigger once on a machine gun, multiple bullets fire, whereas each pull of a trigger fires a single round with bump stocks,” said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston. “People designed it this way deliberately to keep bump stocks from being defined as machine guns under the statute. It’s like the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. The first is specifically to avoid being illegal.”\n",

      "The controversial new rule is in keeping with Mr. Sessions’s practice of closely hewing to White House political directives, sometimes remaining silent in the face of criticism from Mr. Trump and other times rebuking his own employees.\n",
      "Before the Justice Department issued any measures of its own, Mr. Trump had publicly declared that he would use executive authority to ban bump stocks, and he ordered the department to find a way to prohibit them.\n",
      "This month, the Justice Department announced an array of initiatives designed to address the issue of gun violence, sometimes echoing measures that had already been proposed by Mr. Trump.\n",
      "The department said it would help local law enforcement officials hire more school resource officers, help local firearms training programs work with teachers and help states provide faster, more accurate and complete information to databases used in federal firearms background checks. It also said it would provide a $1 million emergency grant to Florida to help cover law enforcement costs related to the Parkland shooting.\n",
      "Mr. Trump had said earlier that he supported the inclusion of mental health information in the background check system and the arming of teachers as part of an effort to deter school shootings.\n",
      "Mr. Sessions also ordered federal prosecutors to more aggressively prosecute gun buyers who lie on gun purchasing applications, a move that The New York Times reported last month.\n",
      "Each year, thousands of prospective gun owners who apply to buy guns through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System are found unqualified to purchase a firearm.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "It is a felony to lie on that application, but the crime is rarely prosecuted. From 2008 to 2015, prosecutors considered fewer than 32 cases a year, according to the Justice Department’s inspector general.\n",
      "“Under my tenure as attorney general, we have already increased federal gun prosecutions to a 10-year high — and we are just getting started,” Mr. Sessions said when he announced those measures.\n",
      "Those past directives acknowledged that gun violence is a problem, but they were unlikely to upset opponents of more restrictive gun policies. In the past, the National Rifle Association has supported some forms of bump-stock regulation, the enforcement of existing gun laws and some background check legislation.\n",

      "By Eliza Sydnor Romm\n",
      "Ms. Romm is a descendent of a founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer.\n",
      "In the early 1880s, legend has it that Daniel B. Wesson, a co-founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer, heard about a child who injured himself by cocking the hammer and pulling the trigger of one of his firm’s revolvers. Wesson, known as D. B., was so distraught about the accident that he and his son, Joseph, developed a more child-safe revolver that they called the .38 Safety Hammerless.\n",
      "Wesson was also my great-great-great-grandfather. Though it has been half a century since my family was involved with Smith & Wesson, I feel a twinge of responsibility every time a mass shooting occurs. I realize this is not entirely rational: I play no part in making or selling firearms and have never lost anyone close to me from gun violence. But it still haunts me.\n",
      "After 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., I learned the shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P 15, a version of an AR-15 military-style rifle. So I had to ask myself: What would D. B. Wesson have wanted his company to do? Would he have accepted the repeated refrain, “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people”?\n",
      "Obviously I cannot know what D. B. Wesson would want. But I would like to believe that he would have recoiled in horror and disbelief at the weapons created by the brand still bearing his name. And that he would have wanted all of us to ask more of his company today.\n",
      "It is only fair for me, for all of us, to demand that our gun manufacturers become leaders in this national discussion around gun violence. They create products designed to kill human beings. The responsibility that must accompany the creation of weapons like an AR-15 is too large to be brushed aside by shouting about freedom and an amendment to our Constitution ratified in 1791.\n",
      "Yes, the company and other gun makers have taken some steps in calling for better enforcement of the national background check system and sponsoring firearm safety programs. But they can do so much more.\n",
      "I would start by asking the parent company of Smith & Wesson, American Outdoor Brands Corporation, to push for gun-violence research. Since 1996 the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been severely restricted in researching gun violence. If gun manufacturers are truly responsible organizations, they should wholeheartedly want to back this research as a public health concern. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the C.D.C. from 2009 to 2017, asked Congress repeatedly to fund research in gun-violence prevention but never succeeded.\n",
      "In response to recent questions from BlackRock, an investment firm that owns the largest share of American Outdoor Brands, the gun maker’s president, James Debney, and chairman, Barry M. Monheit, said, “We must collectively have the courage to ensure any actions are guided by data, by facts and by what will actually make us safer.” Sounds like Mr. Debney, Mr. Monheit and Dr. Frieden are on the same page, so let’s see Smith & Wesson lead the charge in renewing gun-violence research by the C.D.C.\n",
      "I would also ask that the company publicly endorse the Brady Campaign’s Gun Dealer Code of Conduct. It should support requiring universal background checks and a national registry for tracking its products, and indeed all firearms. These measures would help prevent weapons from falling into the hands of the wrong people and make it easier for law enforcement to trace guns used in illegal activities. The refrain that criminals will always get their hands on a weapon, no matter what a gun manufacturer does, is apathetic and unacceptable. What will you do to make it better?\n",
      "Most obvious of all, Smith & Wesson should be pushing to require that all people who buy firearms undergo formal weapons training. Why would any responsible gun manufacturer not want a buyer trained extensively in how to properly use its very dangerous weapon?\n",
      "Do more than you are doing now. Have a purpose other than making money. Take part in this national discussion. Beyond expressions of sympathy, show the families of the victims of Parkland and Newtown and Columbine and Las Vegas and every nameless gun-violence tragedy occurring every day that you care about their pain and suffering.\n",
      "D. B. Wesson was a brilliant inventor who created a better gun than anyone had imagined in the 19th century. When he died in 1906, his guns had made him a multimillionaire. But he also cared deeply about the health and welfare of families and children. In his will, he left $450,000, the equivalent of more than $11 million in today’s money, for a hospital specializing in homeopathic medicine that was built a few years before he died and for the construction of another hospital to provide maternity care.\n",
      "If hearing about one child injured in the 1880s led him to invent the .38 Safety Hammerless, what would the more than 7,000 children killed or injured each year in the United States from gun violence stir in him? I believe if he could, he would beg the executives running Smith & Wesson today to stand up and join the fight to stop this bloodshed any way possible.\n",
      "Eliza Sydnor Romm, a distant relative of a co-founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer, is a small-business owner living in North Carolina.\n",

      "Meet some of the candidates for governor of Illinois attempting to unseat Bruce Rauner, a Republican and one of the most vulnerable incumbents facing election this year. They include a Kennedy and a Pritzker.\n",
      "CHICAGO — Three years ago, Bruce Rauner, a multimillionaire private equity executive, charged into the governor’s office vowing to use “an agenda and a steel backbone” to transform this debt-laden state, where no Republican had been elected to the job in more than a decade.\n",
      "But the bold declarations of Mr. Rauner, who arrived pledging to “shake things up,” have wilted some. As he runs for a second term, Mr. Rauner is one of the most vulnerable incumbent governors in the nation, having spent much of his brief political career clashing with Democrats who control the State Legislature over labor unions, taxes, the state’s budget and schools.\n",
      "“I’m not in charge,” the governor said after leaving an Illinois Farm Bureau conference not long ago. “I’m trying to get to be in charge.”\n",
      "Mr. Rauner, 61, who sold himself as an outsider who would bring a businessman’s sensibility to the task of untangling Illinois’s political and fiscal morass, now finds himself fighting for re-election on two dizzying fronts. On the right, Jeanne Ives, a Republican legislator and Army veteran known for her hard-right stances on taxes, immigration and abortion, has forced him into a contested primary on Tuesday. And on the left, a who’s who of Democratic circles wants to take on Mr. Rauner this fall, including J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire heir and entrepreneur; Chris Kennedy, a businessman and son of Robert F. Kennedy; and Daniel Biss, a suburban state senator.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "It is a campaign that has hopscotched wildly from issue to issue — race, pensions, sexual harassment, clean water, guns, the flight of Illinoisans from their own state, blame for the state’s endless political stalemate, and more. It is on track to be among the most expensive races for governor in history, with more than $150 million raised so far, and Mr. Rauner and Mr. Pritzker sitting on vast reserves of personal wealth to pour into their campaigns. Democrats here, already holding large majorities in the Legislature, are hoping to be part of a national wave that could return control of the governorship to them as well.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Still, for all the national forces and echoes of national issues running through this race, it is in other ways just about Illinois — and this state’s unique brand of politics. The race, for instance, has been haunted by ghosts of governors past. Months ago, recordings emerged of old telephone conversations between Mr. Pritzker and Rod R. Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor who was accused of trying to sell the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated to become president.\n",
      "On one tape from 2008, collected as part of an F.B.I. wiretapping of Mr. Blagojevich, Mr. Pritzker suggested that Mr. Blagojevich appoint Jesse White, the longtime Illinois secretary of state, who is black, to fill the empty Senate seat. On the secretly recorded conversation, Mr. Pritzker called Mr. White “the least offensive” choice who would provide cover “on the African-American thing.” Mr. Pritzker has since apologized for his comments, which have threatened to derail crucial support among black voters. (Mr. Blagojevich was convicted of corruption charges in 2011 and is currently serving a 14-year sentence at a federal prison in Colorado.)\n",
      "As governor, Mr. Rauner is perhaps best known for presiding over a budget crisis that paralyzed Illinois for two years, pressing for so-called right-to-work provisions, and publicly sparring with Michael J. Madigan, the powerful Democratic speaker of the House who also serves as the chairman of the state’s Democratic Party. On the campaign trail, Mr. Rauner sometimes seems to be running not against his actual opponents, but against Mr. Madigan, whose longstanding, entrenched role at the center of state politics has become a matter of debate. In recent weeks, Mr. Madigan has been under intense scrutiny for his handling of sexual harassment complaints at the Capitol and in his political organization.\n",
      "Mr. Rauner has wrestled with his own controversies. He recently spent a week at a state-run veterans’ home linked to the deaths of 13 people from Legionnaires’ disease in a gesture that reminded Chicagoans of the time in 1981 when then-Mayor Jane M. Byrne moved briefly — and very publicly — into the city’s Cabrini-Green public housing project.\n",
      "Mr. Rauner declined an interview.\n",
      "“Throughout his first term, Gov. Rauner has worked to grow good jobs, fight corruption and save taxpayer dollars,” Will Allison, a spokesman for Mr. Rauner’s campaign, said in an email. “The governor’s reform agenda is the perfect contrast to J.B. Pritzker’s outspoken willingness to raise taxes and embrace one-party rule in Illinois under Mike Madigan.”\n",
      "Mr. Pritzker, 53, has received prized endorsements from Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and labor unions including the Illinois A.F.L.-C.I.O. After holding a campaign round table last month with Latino legislators at a Mexican restaurant in Chicago’s Bucktown neighborhood, Mr. Pritzker said that he had decided to run because of his concern that the state is “under siege,” led by a governor “who is a failure.”\n",
      "Mr. Pritzker, a member of a prominent Chicago family and an heir to the Hyatt hotel chain with personal wealth of $3.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine, said Mr. Rauner had fallen short of his promises to help residents of downstate Illinois, where job losses have taken a toll on the economy.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“Bruce Rauner kind of put on his Carhartt jacket and tried to convince people in central and southern Illinois that he’s one of them. He’s from Winnetka,” Mr. Pritzker said, referring to the moneyed North Shore suburb where Mr. Rauner owns a house. “He told them he was going to stand up for them, and he hasn’t.”\n",
      "But before Mr. Pritzker has a chance to challenge Mr. Rauner, he must fend off two other leading Democratic candidates, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Biss, a task that may have become more difficult as he faces questions about his finances and after his comments on race to Mr. Blagojevich.\n",
      "Mr. Kennedy, a real-estate developer, said in an interview that he had decided to run partly because of his worries over people leaving Illinois, a sign of economic decline. Mr. Rauner was given a chance to succeed and has failed, he said.\n",
      "“I think he’s emerged as the worst governor in the history of Illinois and maybe the worst sitting governor in the United States,” Mr. Kennedy said. “Maybe he was a good investor, but he’s a terrible C.E.O.”\n",
      "After Mr. Pritzker’s tape-recorded conversations with Mr. Blagojevich were released, Bishop Larry Trotter, senior pastor of Sweet Holy Spirit Church on the South Side of Chicago, withdrew an invitation for Mr. Pritzker to speak to his congregation, he said, because there “was such rage in the community” over his remarks.\n",
      "“A white, wealthy man gets to say whatever he wants to say about black people and insult black people. How can he be our governor?” he asked in an interview.\n",

      "After meeting with Mr. Pritzker, the bishop reinstated the invitation to speak at his church, which Mr. Pritzker accepted, a spokeswoman for the candidate said.\n",
      "For the moment, Mr. Rauner must contend with Ms. Ives, his Republican challenger in next week’s race. Mr. Rauner has dismissed her as a “fringe” candidate, but Ms. Ives, a lawmaker from suburban Wheaton who graduated from West Point, portrays herself as the true conservative in the race. She says Mr. Rauner is too moderate on social issues. She has described same-sex partnerships as “completely disordered” relationships that endanger children, and has rejected the idea of transgender rights, “something that is made up from the media.”\n",
      "Ms. Ives was widely criticized for a campaign ad featuring actors playing a transgender woman, a Chicago public school teacher and a female activist wearing a pink knit “pussy hat.” But Ms. Ives’s positions have attracted supporters like Richard Uihlein, a wealthy Illinois businessman known for championing conservative candidates, who has donated $2.5 million to her campaign.\n",

      "Perhaps most offended was Mr. Kennedy, who was 4 years old in 1968 when his father, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated.\n",
      "“Well, I wish I could agree with you. I didn’t have a father in my life. Somebody shot him,” he said, as audience members clapped and rose to their feet. Mr. Kennedy then walked off the stage and left the building.\n",

      "What is your classroom, school or district’s policy on walkouts? How many of your students plan to participate?\n",
      "Whether you support the walkouts or not, they are, as an article at Education Week put it, an opportunity to “elevate student voice and action as powerful teachable moments.”\n",
      "To help, you might gauge what your students know — or think they know — about their rights. Invite them to work in small groups to brainstorm answers to these questions, perhaps via a KWL chart:\n",
      "• Do people under 18 have the same rights as adults? If not, how do they differ — and why?\n",
      "• Do students under 18 have the same rights in school as they do out of school? If not, what examples can you give?\n",
      "After students have shared their thoughts and questions, invite them to read “School Walkouts in the Wake of ‘Parkland’ — Protected by the First Amendment or Not?,” a piece from the Newseum that offers helpful context and history:\n",
      "Marches, walkouts and sit-ins are the embodiment of our core freedoms: the right to speak out, to assemble peaceably and petition our government for change. Such protests recall powerful moments in the civil rights movement, when energized groups of young people caught the nation’s attention and successfully pushed for social and political change.\n",
      "The student voices in the Parkland movement also call to mind the circumstances around the landmark 1969 Supreme Court decision Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District, which also involved teens, schools and the freedom to protest.\n",
      "Then, have students follow this overview up with another Newseum resource, ”Classroom Walk-Outs and School Protests: Everything you need to know whether you’re a student, parent, teacher, school administrator, or lawyer” or with the ACLU’s page on “Students’ Rights: Speech, Walkouts, and Other Protests.” Still another resource? The new Youth in Front site, a community-created online learning resource, with advice from experienced youth activists and allies.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Challenge students to return to the original questions for which they brainstormed answers and correct or add detail to anything they now understand better. How would they summarize their answers? What questions are they left with? Where can they find answers?\n",
      "As a final activity for this part of the unit, students might produce a piece for their school website or newspaper clarifying student rights and responsibilities in the context of student activism on gun violence. To do this, they might interview school or district administrators, teachers and students; consult written school policy; and learn more about their school or community’s history of related student activism.\n",
      "Update, March 15:\n",
      "Your students can see videos and photos of and read about the March 14 walkout in “National School Walkout: Thousands Protest Against Gun Violence Across the U.S.” We have also posted a companion Student Opinion question, “Do You Think It Is Important for Teenagers to Participate in Political Activism?”\n",

      "KQED’s The Lowdown has produced a timeline called Too Young to Vote, Old Enough to Take Action: A Brief History of Powerful Youth-Led Movements. To introduce it, Matthew Green writes:\n",
      "This is hardly the first time high school students have led the charge in pushing for nationwide reforms. In fact, the nascent Never Again movement follows in a long tradition of middle and high school students who, despite being too young to vote, have helped lead landmark social and political movements. Among the most recent (and often overlooked) examples include the young people on the front line of the Black Lives Matter movement, Dreamers activists fighting for immigration reform, and the group of American Indian youth who helped spark the Standing Rock movement in South Dakota last winter.\n",
      "As University of Oklahoma professor Kathryn Schumaker noted in a recent Washington Post commentary, student protesters have long risked disciplinary action or worse to force the nation to have difficult conversations about the future they stand to inherit.\n",
      "The Times has also taken on the topic, in a piece headlined “7 Times in History When Students Turned to Activism.”\n",
      "Maggie Astor writes that “history is full of movements led by students — albeit usually in college, not high school. Some were successful and others brutally crushed, but even the latter still resonate.” She also points out that “most of these campaigns have been liberal-leaning: Though conservative college students have made their presence known, their actions have rarely coalesced into broader movements.”\n",
      "Invite students to study the slide show, and read the Times article. What do these movements have in common? How do they differ?\n",
      "Then, invite them to choose one of featured movements and delve into it more deeply. As they do so, they might use the same chart they kept in the first part of this lesson to take notes: What did these students want? What actions did they take to get it? What impact did those actions have, and why?\n",
      "To report back to the class on their findings, they might answer a version of the same questions we asked about the current gun-violence activism:\n",
      "• What actions seemed to be most effective? Why? How were they unique to their time, place and circumstances?\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "• Can we still feel the impact of these students’ activism on this issue? How?\n",
      "• What barriers did they run into? Why?\n",

      "As the Times article summarizes it, the Black Lives Matter movement began with three women in their late 20s and early 30s: Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi. But when it exploded into national view in 2014 after the police killing of Michael Brown, 18, many of the protesters who filled the streets of Ferguson, Mo., were students.\n",
      "But, as this piece in Teen Vogue argues, “Young black people have been fighting to save lives through gun reform laws for years without the support and energy given to the Stoneman Douglas students. In fact, black youth, who’ve been passionately advocating for gun control measures, have been demonized, obfuscated, and overlooked.”\n",

      "\n",
      "            Much of what I’ve done and wanted to do was inspired by Black Lives Matter. We’re protesting the exact same way and being called heroes just because the majority of us are white. America needs to do better in so many ways. https://t.co/TZp0ESCfIv \n",
      "In early March, several of the Parkland students met with students in Chicago to talk about how to combat gun violence in communities nationwide.\n",
      "If your students choose this youth-led movement to research further, they might also address these questions:\n",
      "• Are there differences in how Black Lives Matter student activists have been received by the media and the public compared to the Stoneman Douglas students? If so, what do they think accounts for those differences? What evidence can they find to support their point of view?\n",
      "• What can, or should, be done — whether by the student activists themselves, by the media or by fellow citizens — to make sure all voices on an issue are heard?\n",
      "_________\n",

      "In our lesson plan “Ideas for Student Civic Action in a Time of Social Uncertainty,” we outline five steps students can take together, as explained by Chicago high school teacher Elizabeth Robbins in a TEDx talk:\n",
      "1. Identify issues important in their lives and community, and decide on one to address.\n",
      "2. Research the chosen issue and decide how to change or improve the situation.\n",
      "3. Plan an action, including determining a goal for change; identifying who or what body in the community has power to make the change; and deciding how to approach that person or those people.\n",
      "4. Carry out the action through letters, talks, meetings with officials, policy proposals, and activities, depending on the specific goals of the project.\n",
      "5. Reflect on the effort when it is over in order to understand their successes, challenges, and ways to continue learning in the future.\n",
      "Though our lesson plan offers details for each step, below we’ve added a few more resources that may be helpful.\n",
      " Identify Issues \n",
      "Invite your students to write individually, then brainstorm as a group, as many answers as they can to these questions:\n",
      "• What issues do you care about? Why?\n",
      "• What changes do you want to see happen in your school, community, state, the country or even the world?\n",
      "Students might write their answers on the board, on sticky notes or in a shared class document so that everyone can see the range of ideas. Next, invite them to group what they find into several broad categories. Finally, have students team up around related issues to decide what to do next.\n",
      "Consider a Range of Actions\n",
      "Not everyone is comfortable speaking on camera, or walking out of school for a cause, yet everyone can find something to do to effect change.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Which of the actions students identified when reading about the Parkland students or about youth-led movements in history could help them bring change on the issue they have chosen? How?\n",

      "\n",
      "NEW YORK —  They have walked out, marched and demanded action across America to stop gun violence. But it's far from certain that the young people behind the \"March for Our Lives\" movement will be a political force at the ballot box this fall.\n",
      "Republicans are skeptical. Democrats are hopeful. And outside groups that favor gun control aren't taking any chances.\n",
      "Organizations aligned with Democrats on gun control are spending tens of millions of dollars to ensure that young voters' passion and enthusiasm doesn't fade before the November midterm elections, when the Republican Party's control of Congress will be put to the test.\n",
      "\"Other people look at those young people and think organizing them makes no sense because they don't vote,\" said Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge-fund magnate-turned-liberal activist who has committed at least $31 million this year to what is believed to be the largest youth vote organizing effort in American history. \"We really believe in this generation.\"\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Past voting patterns show how much work Steyer and others have ahead of them. Just 15 percent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 20 cast ballots in the last midterm election.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Still, the mobilization of young people following last month's shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school has raised the prospect of a shift that could re-shape the American political landscape this fall — and perhaps for much longer.\n",
      "Student leaders from Parkland have already succeeded in keeping the gun debate from quickly fading, as is often the case after mass shootings, though that hasn't resulted in any significant congressional action. Hundreds of thousands of people, many of them in high school, participated in protest marches across the country Saturday. New waves of protests are already being planned for next month.\n",
      "Their efforts are being aided by powerful groups that favor stricter gun laws. Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization backed by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, expects to spend more money shaping the 2018 midterms than any other election — and much of it on youth engagement, said chief operating officer Matt McTighe.\n",
      "The organization already spent more than $1 million to help student organizers participate in last weekend's marches. They're now focused on helping high school and college students nationwide organize their own \"Students Demand Action\" groups, a spinoff of the organization's \"Mom's Demand Action\" against gun violence chapters. Everytown also helped young people establish the non-profit group that coordinated the weekend marches, while in some cases paying for nuts-and-bolts items like sound systems and stages.\n",
      "\"They've got the energy. They've got the passion. They don't necessarily have the resources or the policy expertise,\" McTighe said. \"We're going to be investing heavily in these students and making sure they engage in politics in every race and every single district across the country.\"\n",
      "Additionally, groups backed by Steyer, Bloomberg and former Rep. Gabby Giffords will launch nationwide voter drives on high school campuses in the coming weeks. The operation, according to Giffords' executive director Peter Ambler, will especially target \"districts and states where new young voters can have the most impact.\" Giffords' group, like its allies, will also devote significant resources to sophisticated get-out-the-vote operations targeting young voters.\n",
      "\"They're very powerful right now,\" Ambler said. \"I'm very excited to see what they do with that power.\"\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Republican strategists suggest that the youth movement could prove particularly troubling for their candidates in America's suburbs, where dozens of vulnerable GOP House incumbents already face a wave of Democratic enthusiasm and skepticism from moderate Republicans dissatisfied with President Donald Trump's job performance.\n",
      "It's less clear whether a surge in youth turnout would sting Republican candidates in Senate races playing out in rural states like North Dakota and West Virginia, where a fight over gun control could motivate Trump's most passionate supporters as well.\n",

      "Republicans are skeptical that young voters, who typically favor Democratic candidates by large margins, will stay interested.\n",
      "\"Motivation is fleeting,\" said Republican strategist Chris Wilson.\n",
      "While equally skeptical about the short-term impact, Republican pollster Frank Luntz warned his party that a mass migration of young voters to the Democratic Party could endanger GOP candidates for years to come.\n",
      "\"There are a lot of dark clouds ahead for Republicans,\" Luntz said. \"The impact of the youth vote isn't immediate, but it could well have the greatest impact of all.\"\n",
      "Young voters, with few exceptions, have struggled to maintain interest in politics over the last half century.\n",
      "In 1972, when the voting age was first lowered to 18, nearly 56 percent of eligible 18- to 20-year-olds voted, according to an analysis by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. Participation has trended downward ever since, with one exception being President Barack Obama's first presidential election.\n",
      "But in the first midterm election of Obama's presidency, participation rates for 18- to-20-year-old voters regressed to just 18 percent.\n",
      "\"This energy we're seeing right now is in March. The election is seven months away. It takes a lot to keep up this enthusiasm,\" said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of the Tufts center.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "She suggested that interest groups and political campaigns could help motivate young people, as Obama did in 2008, but young voters are more likely to be influenced by people they encounter at home or school.\n",
      "It's also unclear whether issues alone, even one as powerful as gun violence, can lead to lasting political change. Kawashima-Ginsberg's center studied the impact of high-profile ballot issues that might appeal to young voters — the legalization of marijuana and same-sex marriage — in past elections, finding that such social issues alone typically had little impact.\n",
      "Steyer, for his part, is prepared to spend whatever it takes to ensure young voters don't get distracted. His $31 million pledge, he said, is simply \"the floor\" of what he's prepared to spend this year.\n",
      "\"What we're trying to do is organize as well as possible to make sure that they get a chance to raise their voices,\" he said, \"but also to make sure their votes are counted on Nov. 6.\"\n",

      "NEW YORK — Some of Wall Street's heaviest hitters are stepping into the national debate on guns as investment firms ask firearms makers what they are doing about gun violence.\n",
      "The firms speak softly, but because they own trillions of dollars' worth of stock, their voices travel far. And they're now joining forces with some unusual allies, including smaller and untraditional investors. In this context, the investment fund BlackRock, which owns big stakes in three different gun makers, might end up working alongside a group of nuns.\n",
      "Sister Judith Byron, the director and coordinator of the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment, says her group and BlackRock appear to have similar ideas when it comes to gun manufacturers and retailers. Following the killing of 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, funds like BlackRock started asking gun manufacturers what they are doing to reduce the risks of gun violence, and asking retailers how much they make from selling guns.\n",
      "Byron says her group, a coalition of religious communities and health care systems, invested in firearms makers a decade ago and has been working on gun safety issues for years. In the last few months the coalition introduced resolutions pushing American Outdoor Brands, Sturm Ruger and retailer Dick's Sporting Goods to give reports to investors about the steps they are taking to reduce gun violence.\n",
      "\"We're hoping we can engage these big investors and encourage them to vote for our resolutions,\" she says.\n",
      "Some larger investors have similar views. The biggest public pension funds in the U.S., CalPERS, recently refused to sell its investments in companies that sell assault rifles. It says that by remaining an investor, it's been able to get those companies to make positive changes.\n",
      "The nuns aren't protesters, and they don't carry props or signs to disrupt board meetings, although they sometimes work alongside groups that use those tactics. Byron says some of the shareholder meetings she's attended have been downright pleasant, with investors and board members thanking her for asking questions.\n",
      "Support from investment firms was crucial to the coalition's big success last year when, after decades of work, it backed a successful resolution that required oil giant Exxon Mobil to disclose the effects climate change is having on its business.\n",
      "Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said companies are often reluctant to risk any sales in order to do the responsible thing. But it does sometimes happen, as when CVS stores stopped selling cigarettes in 2014. He said activists deserve most of the credit for getting the funds to speak out.\n",
      "\"BlackRock didn't wake up one morning and say, 'We are going to take a different approach to investing, it's the right thing to do,'\" he said. \"It's a reaction to the activists.\"\n",
      "The top priority of firms like BlackRock, State Street and mutual fund company Vanguard is to make as much money as possible for their clients. But because they own so much stock, they can wield a lot of influence: They can support new directors who want to change the direction of the company and back proposals that change the way it operates.\n",
      "BlackRock is a major shareholder in gun makers Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands, and Vista Outdoor Brands. About a week after the shooting in Parkland, BlackRock said it wanted to speak with the three firearms makers about their responses to the tragedy. The fund said it is looking into creating new investment funds for investors that exclude firearms makers and retailers, and if many funds and investors followed suit, that would affect the price of those stocks.\n",
      "In a letter to BlackRock, American Outdoor Brands said it supports steps that will promote gun safety while protecting the rights of firearm owners. The company said it backs measures including improved background checks and improved support for people with mental illnesses, but said it's opposed to \"politically motivated action\" that won't improve public safety. Sturm Ruger did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "In other words, there are limits to the funds' power. They aren't choosy investors and won't dump the gun makers no matter what they say. That's because their main investment strategy to invest in huge numbers of companies, including every stock listed on the Standard & Poor's 500 index.\n",
      "According to Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's director of research into funds and exchange-traded funds, that means BlackRock and Vanguard don't have that much leverage compared to activist investors or hedge funds. Those investors can have more dramatic effects on individual companies because they can buy up the stock, run for seats on the board themselves, or threaten to sell the shares if they don't like the company's choices.\n",
      "\"They can use their wallet and sell the shares or they can pressure the companies and threaten to sell the shares if actions aren't taken,\" said Rosenbluth. So far, he said those investors aren't really getting involved in the debate.\n",
      "Still, there have been changes: Dick's, Walmart, Kroger and L. L. Bean have all said they will no longer sell guns to shoppers under the age of 21. Rosenbluth said that has more to do with the ongoing national debate about gun safety and regulations than anything the investment firms have said, and he believes laws will ultimately have a larger effect.\n",
      "But Byron, who also wants new gun laws, says she is encouraged by the response from corporate America.\n",
      "\"We see companies taking leadership roles in environmental and social issues, which is encouraging,\" said Byron, adding that as shareholders, \"they're our companies. We own them.\"\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Standing before vast crowds from Washington to Los Angeles to Parkland, Fla., the speakers — nearly all of them students, some still in elementary school — delivered an anguished and defiant message: They are “done hiding” from gun violence, and will “stop at nothing” to get politicians to finally prevent it.\n",
      "The students, as they seized the nation’s attention on Saturday with raised fists and tear-streaked faces, vowed that their grief about school shootings and their frustration with adults’ inaction would power a new generation of political activism.\n",
      "“If they continue to ignore us, to only pretend to listen, then we will take action where it counts,” Delaney Tarr, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where a gunman killed 17 people last month, told tens of thousands rallying in Washington. “We will take action every day in every way until they simply cannot ignore us any more.”\n",
      "For many of the young people, the Washington rally, called March for Our Lives, was their first act of protest and the beginning of a political awakening. But that awakening may be a rude one — lawmakers in Congress have largely disregarded their pleas for action on television and social media in the five weeks since the Parkland shooting.\n",
      "That reality helped drive the Parkland survivors in Washington, as they led a crowd that filled blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and Capitol Hill. Thousands more rallied at about 800 “sibling” marches around the country and abroad, where students, like those in the capital, made eloquent calls for gun control and pledged to exercise their newfound political power in the midterm elections this fall.\n",
      "Aerial video captured seas of people — in front of Trump International Hotel in New York; in a central square in Tokyo; along the streets of Boston; at a rally in downtown Fort Worth, Tex.; and crammed into a park less than a mile from Stoneman Douglas High.\n",
      "Delivered in soaring speeches, emotional chants and hand-painted signs, the protesters’ messages offered angry rebukes to the National Rifle Association and politicians who have left gun laws largely intact for decades. A sign in Washington declared “Graduations, not funerals!” while another in New York said “I should be learning, not protesting.” Crowds in Chicago chanted “Fear has no place in our schools” as they marched.\n",
      "Celebrities, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, the “Hamilton” star, and the pop singers Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus, performed in Washington, where politicians and adult activists were largely sidelined in favor of the fresh-faced students offering stories of fear and frustration, but also hope for change.\n",
      "The most powerful, and impassioned, moments came from the surviving students of the Parkland shooting, who declared themselves angry, impatient and determined to stop the slaughter.\n",
      "“Today, we march,” Ms. Tarr said. “We fight. We roar. We prepare our signs. We raise them high. We know what we want, we know how to get it and we are not waiting any more.”\n",
      "An 11-year-old girl from Virginia, Naomi Wadler, captivated her audience as she declared “Never again!” on behalf of black women and girls who have been the victims of gun violence.\n",
      "Calls like Naomi’s stood in stark contrast to action on Capitol Hill and at the White House in the hours before the rallies. President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that took no significant new steps on gun control: It did nothing to expand background checks, impose additional limits on assault weapons, require a higher age for rifle purchases or curb the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n",
      "The spending legislation, which was viewed as the last opportunity this year for Congress to enact major new gun restrictions before the midterm elections in November, included only some school safety measures and modest improvements to the background check system.\n",
      "Organizers at national gun control groups, who provided logistical support and public relations advice as the students planned the Washington rally, said they believed that the students would not become disillusioned by the lack of immediate action in Congress. They noted that rallies took place in 390 of the country’s 435 congressional districts.\n",
      "“The mass shooting generation is nearing voting age,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national group that advocates tougher gun laws. “They know the midterms are six months away, and they plan to make sure that they vote and they get others to register to vote. They are absolutely poised to turn this moment into a movement.”\n",
      "Gun rights organizations largely stayed silent on Saturday, following vigorous efforts since the Parkland shooting to squash any movement toward significant gun control legislation. A spokesman for the N.R.A. declined repeated requests for comment.\n",
      "On the eve of the march, Colion Noir, a host on NRATV, an online video channel produced by the gun group, lashed out at the Parkland students, saying that “no one would know your names” if someone with a weapon had stopped the gunman at their school.\n",
      "“These kids ought to be marching against their own hypocritical belief structures,” he said in the video, adding: “The only reason we’ve ever heard of them is because the guns didn’t come soon enough.”\n",
      "Small counterprotests took place in a few cities. In Salt Lake City, several hundred people gathered near a high school, some carrying signs with messages like “AR-15’s EMPOWER the people.” Brandon McKee, who wore a pistol on his belt, brought his daughter, Kendall, 11, who held a sign that said “Criminals love gun control.”\n",
      "“I believe it’s their goal to unarm America, and that’s why we’re here today,” Mr. McKee said of the Washington marchers. In Boston, about 20 protesters favoring gun control confronted a small clutch of Second Amendment supporters in front of the State House. The two sides quickly got into a shouting match.\n",
      "Crowds gathered in cities across the United States and around the world.\n",
      "The pro-gun protests were swamped in size and enthusiasm by those marching for gun control, many of whom traveled for many hours to attend the rallies in cities across the country. Sebastian Jennings, 18, said he spent 36 hours taking a bus to Washington from western Arkansas. Tour buses lined the streets.\n",
      "Security was tight in Washington, where military trucks and guards blocked almost every intersection near the rally amid a huge police presence, and in other cities where marches and rallies forced the closing of major roads.\n",
      "In towns like Dahlonega, Ga., smaller rallies sought to demonstrate a desire for new gun restrictions even in rural, Republican-leaning communities where gun ownership is common and support for the Second Amendment is strong.\n",
      "“We’re going to be the generation that takes down the gun lobby,” Marisa Pyle, 20, said through a red megaphone to a group of several hundred people gathered in front of the Dahlonega Gold Museum.\n",
      "Around the world, Americans living abroad gathered to honor those who have died in school shootings and to echo the call for gun control.\n",
      "Protesters in Rome jammed the sidewalk across from the American Embassy, next to the upscale Via Veneto, raising their voice in chants — “Hey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go,” and waving signs with messages like “A gun is not fun” and “Am I next?” many made by high school students at an international school.\n",
      "About 150 to 200 people in Berlin gathered in solidarity in front of the Brandenburg Gate, just steps from the American Embassy. Many carried hand-painted signs, among them: “Arms should be for hugging,” “Bullets aren’t school supplies” and “Waffeln statt Waffen” (Waffles instead of weapons).\n",
      "One of the largest rallies outside Washington was at a Florida park not far from Stoneman Douglas High School. During that event, 17 students from the school silently took the stage to represent their friends who had been killed.\n",
      "Anthony Montalto, the brother of Gina Rose Montalto, one of those killed, held a sign that said: “My sister could not make it here today. I’m here for her.”\n",
      "“Turn this moment into a movement,” Sari Kaufman, a sophomore at Stoneman Douglas, implored the sea of students, parents and teachers. She urged her classmates to vote out of office politicians who receive money from the N.R.A. “They think we’re all talk and no action.”\n",
      "But the largest rally, by far, was in Washington, where stage risers and giant television monitors were set up in the shadow of the Capitol — the focus of much of the anger from students throughout the day.\n",
      "One protester carried a sign that said “If the opposite of pro is con, then the opposite of progress is Congress.”\n",
      "Most Republican and Democratic members of Congress had already left the city to return to their home districts for spring break. Mr. Trump spent Saturday afternoon in Florida, at the Trump International Golf Club, less than an hour north of Parkland. A White House spokeswoman said in a statement, “We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today.”\n",
      "City officials had prepared for the biggest march since about a half-million women gathered on the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, declaring a new political movement aimed at resisting the president and his policies.\n",
      "On Saturday, officials with Metro, the region’s subway system, said more than 207,000 rides had been taken on the system by 1 p.m., about half of the number by that time during the Women’s March.\n",
      "A team of crowd science researchers led by G. Keith Still of Manchester Metropolitan University in England estimated that about 180,000 people attended the rally. They examined photographs, video and satellite imagery to estimate the crowd density in different areas of the demonstration. The number is less than half of the 470,000 that Dr. Still estimated had attended the Women’s March in Washington in 2017.\n",
      "Even so, the streets of Washington were packed on Saturday. Teenagers climbed on each other’s shoulders to reach the bare limbs of trees, where they climbed higher. And each student who spoke drew a cheer that matched, and even eclipsed, the applause given to the musical performers.\n",
      "Edna Chavez, 17, a high school senior from Los Angeles, said she had lost her brother to gun violence: “He was in high school when he passed away. It was a day like any other day. Sunset down on South Central. You hear pops, thinking they’re fireworks.”\n",
      "“Ricardo was his name. Can you all say it with me?” she asked. The crowd said his name over and over again, as Ms. Chavez smiled through tears.\n",
      "Naomi Wadler, the 11-year-old student, introduced herself with a soft “hi” and said she represented the black women who have been victims of gun violence.\n",
      "“People have said that I am too young to have these thoughts on my own,” she said. “People have said that I am a tool of some nameless adult. It’s not true. My friends and I might still be 11, and we might still be in elementary school, but we know.”\n",
      "She added, “And we know that we have seven short years until we, too, have the right to vote.”\n",

      "PRAY ME STAY EAGER By Ellen Doré Watson. (Alice James Books, paper, $15.95.) On the evidence of this exuberant poetry collection, her fifth, Watson (who directs the Poetry Center at Smith College) has stayed eager indeed. One poem describes frogs “going nutso down in that sinkhole / pond,” and closes, “they could care / less whether I thank or curse them / for their farty calls speaking sex.” WILD IS THE WIND By Carl Phillips. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) The love poems in Phillips’s 14th collection embrace the paradox of desire and stability, with his customary long lines and discursive, inquisitive voice. BULLETS INTO BELLS: POETS AND CITIZENS RESPOND TO GUN VIOLENCE Edited by Brian Clements, Alexandra Teague and Dean Rader. (Beacon Press, paper, $15.) Clements conceived of this anthology, made up of poems about gun violence and responses from affected readers, after his wife, a teacher, survived the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Contributing poets include Natasha Trethewey, Ada Limón and Ocean Vuong — as well as Clements himself, whose poem “22” concludes with the events of that day and ends, despairingly, “After that, a lot of other things happened, / but it doesn’t really matter what.” COLLECTED POEMS By Galway Kinnell. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $35.) Kinnell, who died in 2014, was a towering figure in American poetry, publishing 10 collections over 65 years; in 1982, his “Selected Poems” won both a Pulitzer and a National Book Award. This is the first volume to gather all of his work in one place.\n",

      "“There would have been no ‘The Da Vinci Code’ without Elaine Pagels’s THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS, her calmly dazzling 1979 reading of a long-hidden trove of early Christian texts. Uncovered in the 1940s, these blockbuster documents kaleidoscopically broadened our sense of what Christianity was and is. As Pagels explains with graceful care, what has come down to us as the religion’s fundamental tenets — regarding the reality of Jesus’ resurrection, the nature of his martyrdom, the status of women, even monotheism itself — were not foregone conclusions but the victors in fierce (indeed, deadly) struggles for social and political authority. It’s always a lot of chaotic battles that got us to the place we are; this is true of the canon in classical music, too, which is why it’s been fun, as I belatedly read Pagels, to also thumb through Nicolas Slonimsky’s hilarious LEXICON OF MUSICAL INVECTIVE, a compendium of all the bad reviews that great works — we’re talking Beethoven’s Ninth, etc. — got when they were new. In both books, history is shown in the messy process of forming.”\n",

      "A 16-year-old girl critically injured in a shooting at a Maryland high school this week died on Thursday night after she was taken off life support.\n",
      "The girl, Jaelynn Willey, was “surrounded by her family” when she died shortly before midnight, the St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office said. She had been at the University of Maryland Prince George’s Hospital Center since Tuesday, when another student shot her in the head in a hallway at their school in Great Mills, Md.\n",
      "Earlier on Thursday, her parents said that she was brain dead.\n",
      "“My daughter was hurt by a boy who shot her in the head and took everything from our lives,” her mother, Melissa Willey, said at a news conference at the hospital as she clutched her youngest child in her arms.\n",

      "Shortly before 8 a.m. on Tuesday, the police said, Austin Wyatt Rollins, 17, opened fire inside Great Mills High School with a handgun, striking Jaelynn and a 14-year-old boy. Jaelynn was shot in the head and collapsed in the hallway outside an art classroom, students said. The boy, Desmond Barnes, was shot in the thigh and was hospitalized. He has since been released.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The authorities were still trying to determine whether Jaelynn and her killer had had a relationship. The sheriff had said Wednesday that they did, but on Friday the office seemed to walk back that assertion, saying merely “they were acquainted.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The shooting, which lasted about a minute, ended in a confrontation between the gunman and an armed school resource officer stationed at Great Mills High. The officer, Deputy Blaine Gaskill, responded almost immediately and fired his weapon at the gunman, who later died at a hospital. Deputy Gaskill was unharmed in the exchange.\n",
      "While it was not immediately clear if the officer struck Mr. Rollins, the deputy’s quick response brought renewed attention to the national debate over gun control and how to prevent mass school shootings after the killing of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last month in Parkland, Fla. Some politicians, including President Trump, have advocated arming teachers and placing additional police officers in schools. Others have criticized the idea.\n",

      "YouTube said this week that it would tighten restrictions on some firearm videos, its latest policy announcement since coming under scrutiny after last month’s mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla.\n",
      "The video-streaming service, which is owned by Google, said it would ban videos that promote either the construction or sale of firearms and their accessories. The new policy, developed with expert advice over the last four months, will go into effect next month, it said.\n",
      "“While we’ve long prohibited the sale of firearms, we recently notified creators of updates we will be making around content promoting the sale or manufacture of firearms and their accessories, specifically, items like ammunition, gatling triggers, and drop-in auto sears,” YouTube said in a statement.\n",
      "YouTube, which described the move as part of “regular changes” to policy, notified users in a Monday forum post. The company had previously banned videos showing how to make firearms discharge faster, a technique used by the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas last fall.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The announcement comes days before planned student-led protests against gun violence on Saturday. It was met with frustration from gun rights advocates.\n",

      "“Much like Facebook, YouTube now acts as a virtual public square,” the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a private group representing gun makers, said in a statement. “The exercise of what amounts to censorship, then, can legitimately be viewed as the stifling of commercial free speech, which has constitutional protection. Such actions also impinge on the Second Amendment.”\n",

      "The policy shift comes as YouTube and other technology platforms face increased scrutiny after the Parkland shooting, in which 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n",
      "Days after that massacre, a video promoting a baseless conspiracy about a shooting survivor became the top-trending video on YouTube, prompting a crackdown on such videos. YouTube’s chief executive also said that the platform planned to fight misinformation by working in partnership with Wikipedia, the nonprofit user-run online encyclopedia. But Wikipedia said it  knew nothing about that plan.\n",
      "Other businesses have also made changes amid growing pressure following the Parkland attack.\n",
      "Dick’s Sporting Goods, Walmart and Kroger all raised the age limit for firearm purchases to 21. The retail chains REI and Mountain Equipment Co-op suspended orders of some popular products because the company that owns those brands, Vista Outdoor, also manufactures assault-style rifles.\n",
      "In 2016, Facebook announced a ban on private gun sales on its flagship website as well as on Instagram, the photo-sharing social network it owns. Anti-gun activists have complained that sellers still found ways around Facebook’s ban.\n",

      "Delaine Eastin, a former Democratic member of the State Assembly and onetime superintendent of public education, is one of nearly 30 candidates running to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown. California Today is planning occasional Q. and A. sessions with candidates for office, and we’re starting with Ms. Eastin. The interview has been edited and condensed.\n",
      "Q. How much do you see yourself continuing with — or not — programs and policies put in place under Governor Brown?\n",
      "A. Jerry Brown has very high marks when it comes to financial responsibility and he’s a strong environmental governor. Always has been. I don’t give him as high marks in education. I give his father the high marks in education. His father was amazing. Having said that, Jerry Brown has a lot to be proud of, and there’s a lot we should continue and I will.\n",
      "Q. How big a problem is poverty and homelessness in California?\n",
      "A. It’s enormous. In your life have you ever seen as many homeless children? Twenty-five percent of the homeless in America are in California. We need to urgently get these children off the street — and their mothers as well.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Q. Is this something the governor has not paid enough attention to?\n",
      "A. He should have declared a public emergency. Some communities are doing things. Sacramento is taking steps. Los Angeles is taking steps. There is not enough being done statewide. The governor should really be stepping up and doing things to prevent this terrible tragedy.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Q. How do you feel about the high-speed train proposed for Los Angeles to San Francisco?\n",
      "A. I hope we can find a way to do it. But I can’t commit to doing it if we don’t find a revenue stream. It really is saying we’ll build a big expensive thing when we can’t afford to give kids health care, we can’t afford to educate kids. There are things that are more important than high-speed rail. If we have to walk away, we will. Still, I’m one who believes that where there’s a will, there’s a way.\n",

      "This week, chiefly in response to questions about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., we heard from new schools across the country, including some in Jersey City, California and Texas, as well as from many students in Greenbrier, Ark. Those comments are still coming in, so we’re sorry if we missed some. We were impressed by the generally civil tone of the conversation over all, and by the thoughtful and honest responses from all points of view.\n",
      "Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear just as they were originally submitted.\n",
      "_________\n",
      "Our most-commented-on post this week was, unsurprisingly,  “What Is Your Reaction to the Deadly Shooting at a Florida High School?” Students unanimously expressed sadness, disgust or horror. There was a wide range of views from students as to the root of the problem of mass shootings in schools, but most commenters mentioned stricter gun laws as a partial solution.\n",
      "BEATTY from SHS Swamp’s comment garnered a “Reader’s Pick”:\n",
      "It’s obviously not right what he did and what all the other school shooters did. The government needs to actually do something instead of showing their “grievance” about the topic. After the Columbine Shooting every town had to have a security guard or a resources officer but as we can all see that has done absolutely nothing. The Florida high school had multiple guards at the school yet he still got in the school, pulled the fire alarm, shot multiple students/ teachers, AND pretended to be one of the students that were trying to escape. The fact that he was able to buy an AR-15 LEGALLY is not good at all. It shows how easy it is to get an AUTOMATIC weapon even with the mental troubles that he as a child and into his teenage years. The US needs to do something about this “epidemic” and they need to do something about it quickly.\n",
      "Anna Marston from Swampscott High School in Swampscott, Mass., said she was going to march in protest:\n",
      "When I received the notification from my iPhone’s “News” app that this shooting took place, my heart sank as I couldn’t begin to imagine the fear rushing through the minds of the parents, teachers, and students whose lives were in jeopardy. While my school has not faced any gun violence, I do recall a time in middle school where a student brought a bullet in their backpack to school — I was petrified.\n",
      "In seventh grade after the Newtown incident, I was too scared to go to school for a few days. Guns — ARs in particular — absolutely terrify me and it blows my mind how it takes this many gun-related deaths to heed attention of the country. My school has practiced lockdowns and mentioned the training of ALICE drills but we have not been trained, and this scares me because I would freeze up and not know what to do in the case of an active shooter. I do not believe there are enough school security precautions nor counseling resources in my high school.\n",
      "Honestly, I don’t feel safe in school anymore. My town is incredibly safe and the “odds” might be low of a school shooting, but this does not mean that we’ll be free of any gun violence as this has been the 18th massive school shooting in 2018 alone. I don’t feel that it’s a problem with my school but more a larger political/cultural/governmental problem in the United States, because schools did not face these same acts of violence in earlier years. I am hoping to attend the March For Life on March 24th in Boston Common to protest.\n",
      "Jianwei Li from Philadelphia said no place was safe until stricter gun laws are in effect:\n",
      "The problem with the school shooting isn’t necessarily that the school isn’t safe or that it has bad security. This is happening again and again and nothing is changing. How do we expect to prevent this if we’re the ones letting it happen? Anyone can be a victim and any school could be the next potential site for another shooting. What we need right now is change. The government needs to make stricter gun laws to prevent dangerous people getting their hands on a gun. If you look at statistics from other countries where they have stricter laws, there are less incidents happening. If a 19 year old with a mental illness can get a semiautomatic rife, how safe really is our country?\n",
      "SLM from Philadelphia had some concrete suggestions:\n",
      "The gun control laws in this country are horrific. No one else has this many mass shootings or as many guns. Australia hasn’t had a mass shooting since 1996. Why is a nineteen-year-old allowed to have a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle? That just doesn’t make sense to me. How many casualties need to happen until someone actually does something about it? No civilian needs a weapon like that. People always say that gun control laws shouldn’t be written because of the second amendment. But you know what, when the second amendment was written, we didn’t have these semi-automatic weapons. If you have psychosis or are prone to manic depression, you shouldn’t have a gun! What if you become sad or angry, and to feel better, you pull out your guns, and start shooting innocent people? That’s not okay! Going to school should not be a thing that makes you nervous or terrified that you are going to be shot.\n",
      "Dexter M from Durham N.C., said there were several issues at once:\n",
      "This is an issue that is deeply rooted in American culture that does not seem to have a single solution. While the FBI has prevented many people inspired by these terrible events. There is always a black market for nearly anything. So banning certain guns will not stop a highly motivated individual, however, I am not opposed to banning certain guns such as the AR-15 or Tech-9 (or any sort of semi-automatic gun capable of firing multiple shots in a couple of seconds). Banning these guns would cease the production of them, and therefore reduce their availability. Another form of gun control that could be implemented is required fingerprint activation. Therefore only the legal owner (or whoever else they put on it) can fire a shot. This would most likely help reduce the mass shooting rates, as most of the firearms used are stolen from parents’ closets or friends’ houses. In this case, the 19-year-old legally purchased a firearm that — in my opinion — should not be legal in the first place. Preventative measures could also be taken on the mental side, as it is not JUST about the firearms used, it’s also about the mental health of wielders. Offering free counseling and mental help nationwide would be a great help.\n",
      "Personally, I do not feel safe going to school knowing these events happen on a (near) weekly basis. While there has never been any gun-related issues at my school that I am aware of, I feel the government does little to prevent these events but give their condolences.\n",
      "Andrew Derushia from Wilmington, N.C., said now was the time to act:\n",
      "What happened Wednesday was horrific, and a serious sign that we need gun law reform. 18 lives were taken from this world at the hands of a murderer who should have never been able to grasp the weapons he used to cause this destruction. Along with the many who agree with this idea, there are also ignorant opposers who suggest the guns have nothing to do with the problem and it is all the person’s fault. Accept these exact same people are raged when background checks and mental evaluations are mentioned as solutions.\n",
      "Contrary to what these pro-gun people say, guns have allowed 18 school shootings to occur before the end of February. On average “6 children or teens are killed per day by guns in the U.S.” Semi-automatic guns which were made for the sole purpose of killing humans shouldn’t be allowed to be handled by everyday people. The gun used in the recent shooting, an Ar-15, can empty up to 800 rounds per minute leaving tens of people dead in seconds. If these guns of horrible mass murder were never allowed into the hands of the public these shootings could have been stopped without such large casualties, and maybe even prevented.\n",
      "The time for gun reform is NOW, the time for change is NOW, the time to act is NOW. For the sake of children and adults across America SPEAK UP.\n",
      "Doug O’Neal from Kentucky said we shouldn’t blame guns:\n",
      "It is a nightmare that no one needs to ever experience, no one should ever have to go through, but I can’t help to feel that the problem doesn’t so much lay with gun control laws than parental control and a failure of the so called system that doesn’t work for the underprivileged or a health care system that sucks. Before the late 80’s stuff like this was rarely ever heard of, but once kids were allowed to play video games where there is uncontrolled violence, prayer removed from schools, and music talking about killing people who have made someone mad, that’s when things started happening. The issues ahead of us is not going to be corrected by stricter regulations on gun control, “guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” the question is why? Lawmakers and legislators should look closer at the real issues and stop trying to blame a tool instead the users and the so called systems that have allowed our children to slip through the cracks of society and become a tool for their political views. The idea of tougher laws on guns isn’t the answer, fixing a broken system is a better start. When our children suffer at the hands of a drunk driver are automobiles blamed? Children are products of their environment and when legislators and lawmakers want to blame guns for the problems we face today all I can say is look a little better at the real issues and stop trying to place blame on an object that can not do anything unless it has someone to use it.\n",
      "rey Hicks from New Orleans agreed:\n",
      "I don’t think guns are the problem here. I think that the customer should be checked out and observed closely and tested by certain individuals with no mental illness. Then it can be decided whether they can pay for it, or they have proper training and all that jazz. This is a sad subject and I wish for the best of the victims of this incident but I wish that you don’t blame guns.\n",
      "Landon Elizabeth from Florida said other countries don’t have mass shootings:\n",
      "I am 15, and I now fear for my safety at school.\n",
      "The first problem is the gun laws itself, we need gun control laws in place, so no unstable 19 year old can go purchase an assault rifle. It’s actually so mind blowing how money hungry congressmen are that they’d rather receive and collect money from the NRA, than do what they signed up for, which is to run and protect this country.\n",
      "Asal Al Mohamed from Wolfeboro, N.H., said guns are illegal in his home country, Oman:\n",
      "First of all, being an international student from Oman, we never have lock down drills or safety precautions because these mass shootings never happen in my country. Guns are illegal in Oman which means that no one owns guns and I’ve also never heard of a shooting in Oman. However, studying at a boarding school in the U.S introduced me to the idea of lock down drills. My school has some safety precautions to prevent possible shootings. Just like fire drills, we have lock down drills that prepare us for this type of incident. We also have good security and doors that are only accessed by students and faculty key cards. So yes, I feel safe in my school.\n",
      "b from Wilmington would like to abolish guns completely:\n",
      "I am afraid. When I walked into school on Thursday I couldn’t help but think of what I would do if someone started shooting up my school. Would I live or die? Would my friends survive? Would I have the courage to help injured people? What would I do. It’s terrible that I and a lot of other people had thoughts like these running through our heads the mornings and weeks after these continuously occurring tragedies. What’s even worse is the innocent lives lost. People with so much to live for gone in an instant. People who would still be alive today if our government would pay attention and DO SOMETHING about it. I’m not saying that I have all the answers and that my opinion is the solution to this epidemic but I know that something needs to be done.\n",
      "If I had it my way I would do away with guns. I know that this is an unpopular opinion and that it is virtually impossible to get rid of all the guns in the United States but that’s what I would do if I could. At the very least we should do with automatic assault weapons, which by definition are used for infantry use, and have better mental health screenings for people trying to license their guns. I hope that as a nation we have a revelation and make an effort to prevent another tragedy like Parkland from happening again by snuffing out this epidemic from the source.\n",
      "Andy G from North Carolina thinks guns are analogous to some drugs:\n",
      "I would like to start off by sending out prayers to the families that lost a close one in their lives, but making guns illegal won’t help. Think of it this way; many drugs are illegal and people still get them, so if guns become illegal people will still find ways to get them. If I could make a solution it would be to give more in depth background checks.\n",
      "Francesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., is exhausted:\n",
      "There are so many things I want to say about this tragedy. There is so much grief, so much anger inside of me that inundated every other sense I felt on Wednesday. So many words I want to say to the gunman, to the high school students who were all irreversibly affected by him, to Congress. But I feel like I can’t anymore. I am so exhausted. So inexplicably tired of the needless and terrifying violence that has gripped America, that we’ve become despicably desensitized to because it happens so often. So tired of just “thoughts and prayers,” and idleness, when already over a dozen school shootings have occurred since the beginning of 2018. So tired of mass shootings being chalked up to mental illness, when mental illness is an issue globally, yet the U.S. is still the only nation where this regularly happens. So tired of hearing “guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” when we should be fixated on the fact that people are being killed in the first place. So tired of seeing that an amendment that was written over 200 years ago is being protected over the lives of children who didn’t deserve this. So tired of every single victim of gun violence being overlooked, not given justice, and forgotten about because our government puts them on the back burner.\n",
      "I am tired, and ashamed of this country and the people who run it. Weapons should not take priority over people any longer. Things need to change. And they need to change now.\n",
      "Olivia Lain from Wrightsville Beach, N.C., wants her children to grow up in a world where gun violence is a thing of the past:\n",
      "In America, mass shootings have become an epidemic. What is the appropriate response to an epidemic? Eradication. When smallpox was an issue, we did all in our power so that no one could get smallpox ever again. Vaccines weren’t given to a select few, they were given worldwide so that absolutely no one would suffer from it, and there hasn’t been a case of smallpox since it was officially declared eradicated in 1980. Action was taken by those in power to eliminate the disease, real action, not just their “thoughts and prayers”. The phrase “thoughts and prayers” should be used in cases of unpreventable destruction, such as an earthquake, and not the destruction that could be solved by the passage of legislation by Congress, preventing such deaths. Banning all semi-automatic guns and assault rifles at the very least would prevent the mass shootings we see all-too-often today. Another phrase that gets tossed around often in the wake of a mass shooting is “guns don’t kill people, people do.” While this is true in a sense, you could kill a lot more people at once with an AR-15 than with a knife.\n",
      "Rennat Hosley from Wilmington, N.C., thinks the Second Amendment is out of date:\n",
      "I have to start off by saying this was very tragic event that happened on Valentine’s Day, I give my prayers to the families whose loved ones passed during the shooting. The way people obtain guns need to be restricted, or harder to obtain, I know the 2nd amendment is the right to bear arms, and people take that law very seriously, but nowadays we really don’t need the weapons. Also many people use the weapon for bad uses like murder, or intimidating people and that’s increasing many crimes. According to the article it says the man was using an AR-15 assault rifle and according to the laws of gun control you can purchase an AR-15 when you’re at the age of 18 with a license but you have to be the age of 21 to purchase a handgun. That doesn’t make much sense from the fact that an AR-15 can be more deadly than a handgun. I hope someday we can fix this problem happening in America.\n",
      "Manuel Garza from Los Angeles focused on the Florida students’ experience:\n",
      "I heard that students were Snapchatting their experience during the whole thing. And that people are calling them out and saying that what they were doing was stupid. Which is very insensitive since the students didn’t know what else to do. One student said that they were all calling 911 and 911 told them to stop calling.\n",
      "Amber M from South Carolina relayed personal experiences:\n",
      "A couple years ago there was a gun incident at my brother’s school — a kid brought a gun to show off to his friends, it accidentally went off. It was chaos for awhile, people didn’t know if it was an accident or not. All my family knew was that a shooting had occurred at my brother’s school, everyone was so worried.\n",
      "At my old school, a kid brought a gun to school this year and went running through the halls with it. He didn’t shoot anyone, but he escaped campus and caused a big police chase. A lot of fear in both of those incidents when families were still figuring out what was going on. Every year we have to watch videos on what to do if a shooting occurs, and they always remind us of the genuine danger that schools can present these days. It’s frightening to have to worry about friends and siblings whenever there’s an incident. Especially in my state, where guns are really easy to obtain, there’s a lot of worry.\n",
      "Luiza Sulea from Philadelphia replied to Amber M and took issue with some schools’ gun policies:\n",
      "Wow, that is so scary. I think that if something like this happened in my school, I’d be too panicked to breathe. Even in these “nonviolent” gun situations, it just shows how terrible and how easy it is to sneak a weapon into school. I read something a while ago that a student wrote. She said that it was against her school’s policy to wear a tube top, but the students were allowed to carry a weapon under 4 inches. I don’t necessarily know if this is true, but I wouldn’t doubt it with all the weapon and gun violence that has been happening recently.\n",
      "Deana Perera from Bryant, Ark., suggested things schools can do:\n",
      "The school shootings that periodically erupt all over the United States are terrible and my heart is filled with sorrow at the thought of so much suffering. May God please bless all those suffering from the shooting yesterday. Thankfully at my high school we have not had to suffer through any shootings recently.\n",
      "I believe that tightening gun laws will only solve half the problem because I feel that schools can do more on their part in taking good security measures. Some pretty good security measures that all schools might want to consider are resource officers and student IDs. The resource officers not only intimidate any one who poses a threat from outside the school, but their presence also effectively discourages violence within the school. Threatening disciplinary action to anyone walking around without a student or administrator’s ID, all schools can be very careful about who they let on campus. Another step schools can take is an alert system that connects to all administrators’ phones so that if there is a threat to the school, all administrative personnel can be immediately notified without having to spread the information through the intercom system and also alerting the shooter. The awful shootings are heart-wrenching and devastate many lives. We need to do everything we can to help each other and keep our schools safe. These precautionary steps aren’t always the cheapest, but can anyone really put a price on how much people’s lives are worth?\n",
      "Oliver D. from Central Texas knows what to do in the event of an active shooter, thanks to a teacher:\n",
      "With the influx of school shootings this year, I feel like the schools in my area are growing less and less safe. A year or so ago, one student made a threat against the school on social media, claiming he would blow up the gym during a pep rally. The next day, after the comments had been posted, the school looked like a ghost town. Parents kept their kids home and kids skipped collectively. We did not address the issue in school, just went on after we realized the threat was empty. The panic of that day, of not knowing if some upset student would come in and target me and my friends or if we were afraid for nothing. My health science teacher, of course, was my savior when it came to situations like this, having given my class a semester of CERT (Civilian Emergency Response Training) I know what to do, where to go, and how to get my classmates out. The ONLY solution is gun control\n",
      "Borad Manuch from Texas reacted to the shooting with “bitter acceptance”:\n",
      "My reaction to the Florida shooting was actually just solidly passive and bitterly accepting. “It was another school shooting, nothing shockingly knew,” I thought. You’d think that at this point in time, after so many school shooting cases, that the higher ups that run our country would have already taken care of it. But as everyone can see now this isn’t the case.\n",
      "While I do understand that the having the right to bear arms is part of the American identity but as a collateral to having that much power in a person’s hand, then there should be strict ways to obtain a gun. I don’t have the slightest idea on how to effectively prevent a school shooting but that is not up to me to decide neither it is my responsibility to do so. But I do know what thing for sure and that is to obviously do something to prevent school shootings.\n",
      "Ronald Zigler from Lansdale, Pa., made an analogy to a myth:\n",
      "I am reminded of the story of the Minotaur, or of any ritual from ancient legend in which children were sacrificed as a form of tribute. The parallels to our contemporary world are only too clear. For far too many politicians and gun-worshippers, periodic human sacrifice is the necessary tribute that sustains their devotion. As Carl Jung, Aldous Huxley and Joseph Campbell would have each pointed out, our modern civilization is but a veneer, that is often quite transparent.\n",
      "_________\n",
      "Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control.\n",
      "A related Student Opinion question, “Can High School Students Make a Real Impact on the Problem of Gun Violence in the United States?” was also popular. Below, we’ve posted first those responses that answer our overarching question, then those that share opinions on guns and gun control in general.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Jason Curnett from Arkansas said students already were making a difference:\n",
      "Can high school students make a difference when it comes to gun control? I say they already are. Why change is happening now, after 19 years since the shooting in Columbine, why it took yet another mass shooting to become highly public, why it took seventeen more deaths, why we had to endure this many tragedies before a change is actually happening, I have no idea. However, the work that the students from Florida are doing is phenomenal. It takes a tragedy to make a change, but it shouldn’t have taken this many tragedies. So, to answer the question, yes they can. In fact, they seem to be doing a better job of making a change than anyone has before.\n",
      "Luke Lamporte from Wilmington, N.C., said his perspective was changing:\n",
      "I am a Republican, born and raised. I am also all for the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, and I believe that the government should not have complete control over our guns. But after seeing school shootings like this over and over on the news, there comes a time when any rational person must think “Hmm, maybe we should try to do something about all these shootings.” What these students went through is absolutely heart breaking. I couldn’t imagine what some of the kids, especially the younger kids must have felt. This is something that will change their lives forever. And if we just choose to see the whole situation as it is, a terrible thing, and if we don’t look at the good that could possibly come from this, then nothing will change. This event, as horrible as it is, sparked a flame of inspiration inside the hearts of these students to go and make a difference and I believe this terrible act of violence does in fact have the potential to turn into something good.\n",
      "Ever since I was old enough to really start watching the news I’ve been seeing almost countless reports on shootings all around the country. Honestly, I found myself growing numb to them. But hearing all these stories of the kids doing heroic things and all the students getting together for a great cause to help save lives and protect future generations has lit a spark in me too. I intend to help these students in any way possible to accomplish their goal of having stricter regulations on guns.\n",
      "Jordyn I from Westfield, N.J., said this generation had the power to change the world:\n",
      "I believe that my generation has the power to change the world more than any group before us. Unlike the generations in decades past, we have more information available to us than ever before. Social media, arguably the most powerful tool of communication in the history of the world, is at our fingertips. With the click of a button, our words can be shared with millions. All it takes is one tweet, one post on Instagram or Facebook. And a second later, your opinion is broadcasted everywhere. The internet has empowered us to have the ability to change the world, even at the young ages that we are.\n",
      "Ryan French from Wilmington, N.C., said school walkouts were showing people that change needs to happen, and happen fast:\n",
      "I do think that there is a way for students to make the government make changes to gun laws. With the school walkouts that are currently happening along with the Moms Demand Action group creating a whole nother separate group, student focused advocacy group, something needs to be done and will be done after more people start to join in on these things. These kids were born into a world where they have to practice lockdown drills and even fathom the thought that a school shooting could happen at their own school.The people affected in this school shooting are speaking out, whether or not they are doing it in public or behind locked doors they are talking about this. Luckily with the power of the internet the students made videos and posted them online where we could see them and see how they really feel about the gun laws. In one of the videos a parent is talking about their child and how she was shot at school and he then says, “don’t tell me there’s no such thing as gun violence”. The video then cuts to people chanting, “no more guns, no more guns”. Now I don’t completely agree with the crowd on this but I do think there should be a change to gun laws and that change and the law needs to happen fast.\n",
      "Emiko Andrews from Wilmington, N.C., said the tragedy had caused students to rise up:\n",
      "I believe that from the ashes of this tragedy, we are seeing high schoolers gain a new voice. From the combination of the age of the victims, to the devastation that occurred on the 14th, to the frequency of mass shootings, many of us are yearning to make change in any way we can, because we see ourselves in the victims. By protesting and walking out of school, and by keeping pressure on representatives and the NRA, we will make our voices heard. Will this effect change? I hope so. I don’t want to keep worrying about being gunned down in my own school, or seeing my classmates die. Emma González is just one powerful voice being heard today, but it will take all of our efforts if we hope to see an end to mass shootings.\n",
      "McKenzie Ingram from Wilmington, N.C., said students should use their voices:\n",
      "After the mass shooting in Florida, many people from my school took to social media to rant about how they hated that this had to happen and how they hated that no action was being taken to prevent it in the future. I’m angry too, I’m angry that this tragedy is something that we have to fight for in order to prevent. In the article, “A ‘Mass Shooting Generation’ Cries Out for Change”, when Delaney Tarr stated that she, “cannot remember a time when she did not know about school shootings”, I really related to her. I remember having lock down drills when I was in early elementary school. No one ever said it but I know that everyone was thinking, “we are doing this for practice if someone ever decides to shoot up our school.” School shootings have become so frequent that I’ve even had multiple nightmares about school shootings. I’ve had around 3 nightmares in which someone brings a gun into my school and starts murdering everyone in sight. Students should not be having dreams about being shot in their schools! Schools should be a safe place for everyone, schools should be a place where students can learn and grow along with their peers. Not bleed and cry out for help. I think that people everywhere should use their voices and call for action. Honestly, it shouldn’t take this much effort for change but I think that if we all stand up for what is right and fight for action to be taken, we can and will end the fears of many people living in America: mass shootings.\n",
      "Monalene Delo from Wilmington, N.C., said a student’s focus should be on getting an education:\n",
      "In a generation where we have grown up hearing about school shootings as a regular occurrence, something needs to be done. It is an absolute tragedy to think of the lives that have been lost as a result of our current gun control legislation. Our generation has become so used to the idea that this can occur. We as students have a job and that is to get an education to make something of ourselves, but when we feel that it is no longer safe to go to school, then what? We need to make a change, in the article the author references a teacher saying “people say it’s too early to talk about it” but when is it the right time? It seems to me that every time a school shooting occurs we talk about gun control, but when will we actually take action. One recent movement “Never again” has been started by the students in Florida’s most recent shooting to advocate for more gun control. We are the generation of change. Previous generations will never understand the fear that goes through our minds. “It could have been my school, my friends.” Enough is enough. We as students should not have to worry for our safety at school. Our main focus should be getting an education. Students shouldn’t have access to guns. We need to speak up, not be afraid to talk to our teachers, counselor, and school resource officers. If we hear of anyone that could be a threat to our safety. We need to think about how this affects the lives of our students and protect them to the best of our abilities.\n",
      "Colby Linn from Arkansas said background checks were a good idea:\n",
      "By a Liberal’s logic on gun control, the best way to solve drunk driving would be the take cars away from sober people. This is what they are trying to do with firearms. There are millions of law abiding gun owners across America who use firearms as personal defense weapons, for hunting, or just for collecting. Illegal or not, if someone, like Nicholas Cruz, is crazy enough to commit murder on that scale, they will get their hands on a gun one way or the other. There are many alternatives to a ban on firearms, such as increased screenings and background checks, which I am fully behind. No mentally unstable person should be able to legally purchase a gun. Another thing is arming and training teachers. If the teachers in Florida were armed and trained, then the death count could have been much lower. Again, a direct ban on firearms will do nothing but harm, and as a U.S citizen it is an explicit infringement on the second amendment.\n",
      "Addison Duncan from Greenbrier, Ark., said some restraint is needed:\n",
      "Most of my family are strong Republicans. I grew up in a Republican house. I am also a firm believer in the Second Amendment. “The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms and was adopted on December 15, 1791, as part of the first ten amendments contained in the Bill of Rights.” I mourn for the lives lost in the Florida shooting, but I believe that we need to take some sort of precaution. My father has his concealed carry license. The ONLY reason he carries a handgun EVERYWHERE is for the protection of my family. If someone comes and tries to shoot MY family, he can protect all of us because of his concealed carry license.\n",
      "My parents worry every day for my sister and I to go to school because it could happen to anyone. In the small town of Greenbrier, Arkansas, NO one would EVER imagine a mass shooting here. Our parents NEVER had it this bad when they were in high school. Our perspective on this is VERY different than the older generation. Some people do not realize how uncomfortable it is to go to a public school now. My mother has constantly told me, “Addison, when I was in school, it was NEVER like this...” Overall, we need to have some sort of restraint, but not so harsh that we cannot have guns at all. I hope that being educated on this topic can have some sort of impact on our society today.\n",
      "David B from Arkansas said he had always feared the damage guns can cause:\n",
      "All of my life, I’ve grown up around guns, yet I’ve always had a fear of the damage that they can cause. When I was 10, I shot a gun for the first time; a .22 caliber long-rifle, and I loved it. I know that I’ve always been a good shot, and it was great to one-up my older brother with my accuracy. Guns are practical; they are tools that we use to hunt and that we use in War. As I was always told as a child, guns are not toys.\n",
      "I believe that guns are not the problem in our world, but instead the fingers that pull the triggers that are problematic. A gun cannot shoot itself, but instead a mechanism is pulled back to strike a pin and thus fire a bullet. A human finger causes the gun to fire; a human mind causes the human finger to move. The mental state of a human determines whether or not innocent lives will be lost; not a gun. Say that a shooter were to come into a classroom, and open fire on students. What would students do? They would be completely defenseless against the bullets. One way to solve this is allowing teachers to conceal-carry guns to school. Even if the teacher is shot down in attempting to defend the classroom, a brave student would likely grab the teacher’s gun and defend the classroom by his or her self. If the government allows teachers to conceal carry a weapon, there should be certain rules set into place, such as a carrying teacher’s anonymity. Overall, school shootings are a problem that is growing. The government should restrict people, not guns\n",
      "Bailey Stovall from Greenbrier, Ark., said the issue needed to be addressed:\n",
      "While most of us can not even vote yet, we certainly all share one thing. We have a voice. A voice that we can project and allow many to hear in hopes someone will listen and actually address this issue instead of sweeping it under the rug. As said in the article, situations like this “don’t need to be approached so early”, but we are far too late. This needed to be approached much before, and not just talked about for maybe half a month and dropped when something new comes to the news. No, this is an issue that needs to be addressed much more often, and high school students, the ones that have participated in the lock down drills for so long, can help raise awareness to it.\n",
      "Tira Frazier from Arkansas said we needed gun control despite the Second Amendment:\n",
      "The Second Amendment is our right to bear arms, which allows us to have guns. Freedom or not, I believe we need gun control. We do not need AR-15s lying around. Guns less likely to do damage should still be around, that’s all. This is a mental health issue just as much as it is a gun or person issue. We need to be aware that this is how it has to be: it takes 17 people to die for this to be brought up again for what to happen: nothing? This is not Liberal V. Conservative. This is a battle against unnecessary killings that take the lives of those that are precious to us. As a high school student, we can use our voice all we want and hope we get justice. Mention our peers that are dying because of gun violence, and maybe we’ll get results.\n",
      "Classic Smith from Greenbrier, Ark., said to take guns away from mentally unbalanced people:\n",
      "People will say that it’s not the guns, but the people. That is just stupid. If the people that have the guns are mentally unsound then we need to take the guns away from them. Some people will say that outlawing guns will only keep it away from the average person and only criminals will have them. However, people who have remote access to them; black market don’t do crimes like this, they assassinate people and don’t get caught. Also nearly every gun that is on the black market was purchased legally and is then sold illegally.\n",
      "Presley Cullum from Arkansas said we needed stricter requirements to buy a gun:\n",
      "I believe that our country should take action to stop these school shootings. We have already had more mass shootings in 2018 than most countries have ever had! I don’t agree in banning guns completely but I do think we should definitely have some stricter laws on acquiring them. People need to go through a longer process and have to meet stricter requirements to buy a gun. Although this won’t keep all harmful people from getting guns, it will be a whole lot harder and possibly decrease the number of shootings. I most definitely think we shouldn’t just sit back and let these terrible shootings keep happening. A change needs to be made.\n",

      "I will be attending tonight’s opening at a 3D theater. I am not a Black Panther or Marvel fan, preferring drama and science fiction. My reason to attend is to participate in the excitement of the birth of a new cultural touchstone for African Americans.... As a fashion enthusiast, I am also excited at seeing how those of us who will dress up will interpret the esprit of everyday Wakandans.\n",
      "Nyah Price from Providence, R.I., thinks the movie will change people’s views on black actors:\n",
      "I can’t wait to see Black Panther, I’m practically counting down the hours till I get to see it. I am a black, female, superhero nerd and I can say that Black Panther is a Marvel hero that many nerds have been waiting to see as a live action movie. Growing up he was a character that I looked up to because he looked like me, he had dark skin, and I also looked up to his wife (Storm from the X-Men who I hope they have to meet T’Challa in the upcoming movies). Black Panther represents something that resonates with people, he is a strong, powerful, confident black man that rules a country with a tender heart. Now this generation can see what I, a sixteen-year-old girl, and the generation before me got to love and enjoy. The cast is made up of beautiful actors that get to show us their representation of a story that I grew up hearing. This movie is going to change people’s views on what black actors, and superheroes, are made of.\n",
      "Janelly Polanco from Rhode Island said the movie catered to all ages and all people:\n",
      "Watching Black Panther has been my weekend plans since its creation was announced. This movie is not only in the superhero genre, aka the best kind of movie, but it features an all African American cast. With such lack of African American actors in big, successful movies, the wait for this movie has been a long one. Watching this movie will allow people EVERYWHERE so see black excellence and success. The setting of the movie even portrays the theme of black excellence and success. In society today, with so much hatred and rare unifying instances, a movie that caters to all ages and all people is much needed. This movie has been unifying for POC I know. Even people who know absolutely nothing about the background and creation of the movie are excited to watch it.\n",
      "Brandon Navarrete from Wilmington, N.C., thinks the movie will unite African-Americans:\n",
      "I am totally going to watch the Black Panther, with my family and friends. I believe this movie will be a huge hit for Marvel and will also bring in many fans on opening weekend. I have seen the previews for this and it looks beyond good, it seems action packed, exciting and it will have a good story line leading into Marvels Avengers: Infinity War. Apart from this, Kendrick Lamar co-produced a genuine soundtrack that sounds amazing, it adds extra excitement to the movie in my opinion.This movie alongside others from MNarvel such as Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok, are connected to Marvel’s biggest movie coming in May. Apart from the entertainment aspect of this movie, there are also cultural and political sides to it, which is why I think it’s gathering so much interest among fans and critics. According to the article there hasn’t been as much hype to African-American audiences since Spike Lee’s “Malcolm X” in 1992. A huge key factor is that the cast is mostly African American apart from Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis. I can say I agree with the statement that Mr. Grey stated saying that this film should be understood in a political context in which both the legal gains of the civil rights movement and the interracial optimism of Obama era have been undermined. This movie will bring people together and unite African-Americans, the concept of this whole project is truly amazing. It’s going to be a grand expression of cultural pride for the African-American population\n",
      "Tyler Rouse from Wilmington N.C., said the movie offered superhero equality:\n",
      "Heck yeah, I’m gonna see Black Panther! It looks like a great movie especially because it has already had so much success. It’s great to finally have a superhero movie with a black cast. This is probably a big reason why it has so much interest. Many black children and little girls only have white male superheros to look up to. It’s great to finally have a black superhero that isn’t a sidekick. Also, Hollywood is starting to have more female superheroes such as Wonder Woman, the Scarlet Witch, and the Black Widow. I love how more women and people of color are getting better opportunities in the movie industry. It’s a huge advancement in equality with jobs. Especially the movie business. I am a white male that grew up loving Captain America. It would be sad to grow up as a black child or little girl without a superhero to identify with. I was Captain America for Halloween for three years in a row. It’s time for little girls and children of color to have a chance to be a superhero for Halloween.\n",
      "Ryan French from Wilmington, N.C., bought tickets for opening night, and said the soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar was “fantastic”:\n",
      "I cannot wait to see Black Panther, I actually just bought my tickets for opening night. This film has been getting hype ever since they announced it back in October of 2014, and it deserves every second of it! Chadwick Boseman’s performance as Black Panther in Captain America Civil War was phenomenal and was the highlight of the movie to me. Now two years later he’s getting his own film and I am so excited. The whole cast is primarily African-American excluding Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman but the whole cast is super stars. They have Michael B. Jordan as the main villain (Erik Killmonger), Luptia Nyong’o (Star Wars the Force Awakens), Forest Whitaker (Rogue One), Daniel Kaluuya (Get out) just to name a few. This film is shaping up to be one of Marvel’s (yet again) grand slams. The movie is a superhero fan’s dream of a Black Panther movie, and it could really intrigue common movie goers too. The soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar is fantastic and just another reason to go and see the movie. Finally we have the reason people are probably most excited for Black Panther, it is the last Marvel movie before Avengers Infinity War and everyone is excited to see how this leads into Marvel’s biggest movie ever.\n",

      "Jared Duarte Massachusetts said hip-hop had been a lifelong love:\n",
      "My favorite genre of music is Hip Hop, I’ve been “really into it” ever since eighth grade but I’ve actually been listening to it all my life. Examples of artists: Future, Drake, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Eminem, Ed Sheeran, NF, Lil Uzi Vert. I’m more into the rapping side of hip hop rather than the actual singing, so i guess that’s where the “Old School Rap” comes into play. I used to listen to only rock songs with my Mom, Dad and Brother such as songs by A.C.D.C., Doors Down, and The Beatles but the music started to leave my mind while listening to the radio with friends because when they grew up they were listening to hip hop or both hip hop and rap. Either way my generation grew up with hip hop being more popular then most other genres. Many of my family members don’t listen to hip hop but my cousins do and as a kid I would spend a lot of time with them at my grandparents and we would I guess connect to what the artists were singing or rapping about. So yes I believe I have forged my lifelong taste in music and that taste is hip hop.\n",
      "Jimbus Supreme from Cool Person Avenue thinks the information is unsurprising:\n",
      "1. Nothing in the article, despite the fact that the information was new to me, particularly surprised me. It makes sense that a person’s taste in music solidifies during a time which their brain is finishing development; ages 11 - 16. 2. I’ve never had a “favorite song,” but one artist I was introduced to when I was around 14 was Mac Demarco, whom I still thoroughly enjoy listening to at 17. 3. The reason early teen years are significant for forging a person’s music taste is because during the early teen years, a person’s brain is beginning the final stage of development. At this time, a person is more open to ideas and music. Once a person’s brain is effectively developed fully, though, they are less open to new ideas and in conjunction, new music. 4. Talking to my parents and other adults around their age (50’s), I have noticed that they generally enjoy the same musical artists; the Beatles, ELO, Queen, etc. Generally, these bands were popular during a 50 year old’s teenage years, so it does support the evidence. 5. Mainstream music is repeated garbage, so the challenge is actually listening to it as a parent. Most mainstream billboard hits use the exact same elements, and act as money generation machines, not music. Musical complexity is low, tracks are compressed to hell, and all of them use almost identical melodies. Often, listening to this type of music is unengaging for parents who grew up listening to much more varied, complex, and creative music.\n",
      "Kate Silver from Wilmington N.C., said her taste in music was ever-changing:\n",
      "My music taste is constantly changing. If you asked me a year ago what my favorite song was, I can guarantee that my answer is different today. Every few months, I have to erase my Spotify playlist and start from scratch because I get sick and tired of the songs on it. Just three months ago, I was obsessed with The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and three months before that, I would only listen to mid-2000s rock. Assuming this trend continues, I can’t imagine myself liking the same music I like now in 20 years. The music industry is perpetually evolving. Artists are always striving to find new ways to make their songs stand out and keep their audiences coming back for more. Who knows, maybe my favorite song will be one in an entirely different dimension that has yet to be discovered. 20 years is a long time from now.I will admit that I’ll blast Taylor Swift’s “You Belong With Me” when it comes on the radio and bask in the joy of still knowing all the words. Like the men in their 30s who love “Creep”, I will always have a special place for the songs that remind me of my childhood in my heart, but I look forward to discovering new songs and further developing my musical taste.\n",
      "McKenzie Ingram from Wilmington, N.C., thought the age range would be older:\n",
      "In this article, I really did not expect that the age where we usually find our “lifelong taste in music” would be 13 or 14 years old. I expected the age range to be around 20-27. Personally when I was around 13 or 14 I had quite a broad range of music but it’s nothing compared to the wide range of music that I listen to today. I mainly listened to “emo” bands such as, Good Charlotte, My Chemical Romance, Twenty One Pilots and A Rocket to the Moon. I think that the early teen years are significant for forging a lifelong taste in music because in these early years we are starting to truly realize who we are and who we want to be. The music that we listen to in this time is significant because we are in the midst of discovering what we want to do in life and how we want to do it, and the music follows us along the journey and reminds us of who we are. I feel that today, older generations struggle with the amount of swear words that are used in most songs today. Growing up in past generations, swearing was considered sinful and impolite. So now when older generations hear these words on the radio, they are typically astounded and wonder why these artists have to use such foul language to share the message of their song (or at least that’s what my mom does).\n",
      "Parker Maner from Wilmington N.C., said the research was flawed:\n",
      "In my opinion I don’t think the music I listen to today will be the same that I chose to enjoy as an adult, mostly because there will always be a new rap artist/album with a better flow than the one from a couple weeks ago. Now that seems like a pretty rude answer until you realize the flaw in the article... The title asks about your taste and I agree with. But the article shares research that for men that are now 38 rate “Creep” by Radiohead as the 164th on the charts, it then shares the song came out when they were 14, and it wasn’t as popular for men either 10 years older or younger. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz comes to the conclusion that when the men are 14 the songs they like then shape the songs they listen to for the rest of their life. I think this is wrong and if it is correct it needs a different, wider data set. The research tells you that the men still like the song, not that they listen to similar songs in the genre. I believe a similar explanation to explain the data is that men in women are in middle school, I mean junior high while they are 13 and 14, it has been shown that these are a challenging times in life. Songs that got them though that bring back great memories and that’s why they are popular for these men. I think other songs in the genre from when they are the age of 13 or 14 need to be compared to songs that are more recent that share the genre. Therefore I don’t agree with the article when the title is different from the research.\n",
      "Emilia Cordon Wilmington, N.C., was exposed to classical music through ballet classes:\n",
      "I’ve had trouble really finding my musical taste recently and was surprised after hearing that my preferences have probably been set already. From a young age my primary exposure to music has been through ballet and my parents. In ballet we listen to classical nonstop and I’ve grown to really appreciate it but it never particularly struck me. What really struck me at a young age was those long car trips with my dad listening to Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Police, and The Doors. Just nonstop jamming out to Bohemian Rhapsody, Black Dog, Roxanne, and Break on Through ingrained some of the best songs in the sweetest part of my memories. But I never truly found my taste until recently when I whipped out some classic Metallica and Megadeth from my dad’s collection and was swept off my feet. I felt like I knew myself, and I know that I will never stop loving metal. I don’t know why the early teens are so instrumental to musical taste, but know that for me I’ve always really liked the same music, just couldn’t really pin in down. Just play me some classic rock and I’ll be good.\n",

      "As we noted last week, our Student Opinion question, “Is Student Debt Worth It?,” was suggested by a teenage reader. While nearly all students agreed that going to college was worth taking out loans to pay for it, they had different ideas about how much and for which kind of schools.\n",
      "Aubrey Ella Hyldahl from Wilmington, N.C., thinks all students should consider cost when making decisions about college:\n",
      "College is a unique experience, and with that comes unique needs. I am a sophomore and have recently started looking and touring colleges to get a feel for what I want in a school and learn more about what I need to do to get there. Over the summer, I looked at Davidson College, a small, private, liberal arts college. I completely fell in love with the school and everything it had to offer. It seemed like the perfect place for me, except for the hefty price tag that comes with it.\n",
      "Around the same time, I toured UNC-Chapel Hill. Unlike Davidson, it is a huge school, which is something I’m not sure I want. However, the quality of education I would receive would be excellent at this state school that is tens of thousands of dollars cheaper.\n",
      "Initially after these two visits, Davidson was my favorite followed closely by UNC. I thought that I could handle the immense debt that would come with it, because I was inclined to follow my heart. However, after thinking about it more, UNC soon started to encroach on Davidson’s #1 spot. The reason for this is simple; I don’t want to lock myself into a major that is more lucrative than something I love to do, just to pay off my loans for a school that offers a similar education to many cheaper public schools.\n",
      "This is not to say I won’t apply to Davidson, but cost and debt should 100% be factored into the decision of which college to go to, especially if you can’t see yourself in a highly lucrative career.\n",

      "As a current high school senior applying to college, I am well aware of the fact that depending on the college I may attend, paying off debts in the future is a likely outcome. I feel that now more than ever, at least from what I’ve personally observed, both parents and children are much more hands-on with the process, consistently weighing the pros and the cons. My family has taken the question of finances more seriously than any other topic regarding the admissions process, and it will be a driving factor for the school I choose. Especially because my family and I didn’t grow up entirely in the United States — I was born in Australia, and have since lived in Singapore and Great Britain — until recently, we weren’t aware that we may have to pay a quarter of a million dollars for a bachelor’s degree (which both my mother and I find somewhat ridiculous in the first place), nor did my parents know they would have to save up from my birth in order for me to attend certain institutions in the U.S. that may potentially cost more. Right now, I’m looking at colleges in Canada partially because my Canadian citizenship makes the costs much less expensive. I have kept in mind throughout this process that realistically, wherever I may end up — even if it isn’t my “dream school” — not only is it going to be a fantastic institution where I will get an exemplary education, but I’m also going to find a way to make it my home for the next four years, and a place I will truly enjoy and love.\n",

On one hand, I see debt at a more prestigious institution as an “in” to better jobs as more prestigious institutions carry more weight in job hunting for recent graduates. On the other hand, for those intending to pursue a post-secondary degree I think it’s better to go somewhere you will have less debt to pay off as grad school, medical school or law school are even more expensive and it’s better to save money in undergrad.\n",

That being said, it is essential for students to factor in costs in their college choice. An honors college at a state school can provide as good an education as a highly ranked liberal arts college, even though the public university costs considerably less.\n",

In all honesty, it has always been my dream to attend a prestigious college. A dream that seems unattainable because of the schools’ cost nowadays. I come from a working-class family so paying off such high debts would prove a challenge. In order to relieve the strain that debts may place on my family, I would choose a school based on its affordability. After all, the success of a student does not necessarily depend on the school they attend. Ambition is what determines success, in my opinion. Ultimately I would like to choose my career based on my interest but a high-paying job will definitely be appealing to me because I will need to pay all my loans. Yes, student debt is a problem in the United States but apparently, it is merely a consequence of acquiring an education.\n",
      "Brandon Brodwater from Wilmington, N.C., says an honest conversation around finances can help students make smart decisions:\n",
      "Both of my parents came from extremely low income households. Money was always tight, so they were both completely on their own as far as paying for college. Even a small state school or community college was expensive. Both of them were in the first generation of their families that achieved a higher education, and had zero knowledge or assistance in process and payment. The only thing that they both had was drive. Today, they are both Ivy League graduates with no debt between them. Through hard work and focus, they were able to receive an education and pay off their loans. I have complete respect for them.\n",
      "Now that my bias is out of the way, I believe that student debts are worth every penny. A college education opens an unlimited amount of doors for the future, and with hard work and dedication, can pay for itself. Now, that being said, I also believe that many students are misinformed about what going to college entails. As Michael Arceneaux said, after taking out thousands of dollars in loans, “no one mentions just how expensive and soul-crushing the debt will be”. This is where a better pre-college education is necessary. I believe that it is important to be realistic about college with high school students, as opposed to only discussing its benefits. Teenagers need to be informed of the debt they will most likely accrue, and helped to plan school choices accordingly. If we emphasize smart financial decisions, people like Michael will have better debt situations.\n",
      " Sadie Gaffin from Providence, R.I., believes the government should do something about student debt:\n",
      "I have always known that going to college would be expensive, but this article really reinforced everything that every adult has ever told me about the cost. When I was younger, I really wanted to go to NYU and become a pediatrician, however I recently came to the realization that NYU is one of the most expensive colleges in the United States, so I have taken it off my list. I also still want to be a doctor, but my mind is not as set on being a pediatrician as it once was. That being said, I do not have a specific dream school because there are so many schools that have programs that will aid me in becoming the doctor I want to be, so I do not need to be narrow-minded about a school just because it is one that everyone knows the name of. The school I go to will be a good school and will not put me in too much debt because I do not want to owe the bank for the rest of my money. I might take out some loans but as little as possible. I do believe student debt is a problem in the United States and it has gotten increasingly higher over the past few years. I do not want to take part in it and I hope that the government gets a grip on it. There are quite a few countries around the world where they offer their citizens free, or close to free college. Education is extremely important no matter where one lives, so I hope the United States can realize this and make it more affordable so that all students can have access.\n",
      "And Anna Cross from Wilmington, N.C., summed up a lot of students’ anxiety with this thoughtful and humorous comment:\n",
      "I have no idea what to do about my future student loans. In high school, it’s drilled into you that a fancy college and a high degree is your ticket to a happy, successful life. “Just rack up the debt, kids, you’ll pay it off with your neurosurgeon’s salary”. But what they don’t tell us is that most student loan providers give you only six months after you graduate to get a job and start paying your dues, and it’s awfully hard to set up your life and start making bank in about 26 weeks. This means that hopeful young adults in lower to average income families are stuck in a pit of debt they can’t climb out of, weighed down by paying off loans when it’s time to start saving money for their own lives. Here comes the stories of living off of ramen and sleeping in your parent’s basement; students don’t have the cash to pay their credit card bills, pay rent, or properly feed themselves. And according to recent statistics, the costs of tuition are only going up.\n",
      "My class and I will be graduating in 2020, the election year. I suppose my only hope now rests upon Oprah for a change in the education system. Perhaps I’ll wait a year before going to college, just until the legislation passes through.\n",

      "Sports fans chimed in with their favorite moments of the “2018 Winter Olympics” so far.\n",
      "Alexis Lariviere from Hoggard High School was inspired by the youngest gold medal winners:\n",
      "The Olympics is an anticipated event that so many people enjoy to watch, me being one of them. My family and I enjoy watching the Winter and the Summer Olympics together. Most of the time the Olympics don’t impact me much, but this year the games have actually been very inspiring to young athletes all around the world.\n",
      "So many young kids have taken home medals this year in the Winter Olympics. It is very inspiring knowing that someone still in high school (or just out of high school) has the potential to win something as big as the Olympics. This shows that no matter how young you are, if you really try for something it will happen. This statement relates to the article about Mikaela Shiffrin because when she first competed in the Olympic Games, she went home in 5th place. Mikaela wasn’t happy with her score so she kept practicing until she came back to the Olympic Games and won first place. Just a little hard work and determination changed her life.\n",
      "And Josh Failla from Wilmington, N.C., was especially impressed by Red Gerard:\n",
      "The Olympics, either winter or summer, is my favorite sporting event. The only problem that I have with it is that we have to wait every 2 years to be able to watch the incredible athletes from around the world perform on the highest level. The competition is not the only thing that I love about the Olympics. I love how it is the perfect stage for all countries to put away their differences and to come together to celebrate. I also learn about sports that I have never heard of, and every year I learn something new. I never realized how tough and dangerous a sport like skeleton is. It may just look like they are not doing anything, but it takes tremendous control to keep the sled on the track.\n",
      "The most mesmerizing moment for me in this years Olympics is Red Gerard, the 17 year old US snowboarder that won gold in the slopestyle event. He is the youngest male Olympic snowboarding champion ever. It is hard to imagine how a kid only a year older than me is able to win the gold on the world’s biggest stage. He is half the age of some of his teammates, and it gives me motivation in my life that just because you are young doesn’t mean that you can’t make a difference. I can’t wait to see what else the Olympics has in store.\n",
      "But Luke Lamporte from Wilmington, N.C., was motivated by watching veteran athletes:\n",
      "My favorite moment of the Winter Olympics this year was seeing Shaun White make his return to snowboarding and take home the gold. I’ve always been a huge Shaun White fan and used to love watching him pull off near impossible tricks on the halfpipe and take home gold after gold after gold at such a young age. Now seeing him come back and do it at a much older age just shows the true talent that this man has. I’m inspired by his drive to get better and his passion for the sport and one day hope to have the same for whatever I do in my life.\n",
      "Several students found joy in the way the Olympics have brought together a seemingly divided world. Abby Tank from Wilmington, N.C., said it best:\n",
      "I absolutely love the Olympics — both winter and summer. I always look forward to cheering on Team USA, and this year, it’s been great to see younger athletes dominate at the Winter Olympics such as Red Gerard and Chloe Kim. You can find me sitting on my couch, squeezing the life out of a pillow when Team USA is competing in any event. Throughout the day, I’m constantly checking for updates on the Olympics, whether it’s the current medal count, results, etc. But what’s even better to see this year than Team USA is South Korea and North Korea united under one flag. It’s amazing to see what effect sports has on the world. The Olympics are respected and revered around the world, and this year have caused the seclusive North Korea to join with its southern counterpart. This Korean team represents peace, and I find myself rooting for their team just as much as Team USA. I appreciate how far they’ve gone to being a unified team, especially by making a joint women’s hockey team. Even though they haven’t won a single game this Olympics, the fact that they’re playing together is the best win of all. We can only hope that this unity and peace that are being experienced in the games will translate into a much greater picture in the future.\n",

      "Students gave insightful responses to our Student Opinion question: “Do You Think Porn Influences the Way Teenagers Think About Sex?”\n",
      "Luke  from Wilmington, N.C., thinks it does in many ways:\n",
      "I, as a teenager, definitely believe that pornography has and will continue to corrupt the impressionable minds of us teenagers. I mean think about it, “porn” is basically everywhere now. All it takes is one click to find it on your phone. There are entire magazines dedicated to it. Movies all about it. Music that essentially talks about it. It’s almost like there is no escaping it. Porn has consumed our world one way or another whether we like it or not. Porn affects the way people think even without them knowing it. The porn industry makes women look like toys and discourages their pride. I believe sex is a sacred thing created for humans to reproduce and should not be put out on the internet for the entire world to see. It also changes the way men see sex. Young kids have access to porn and if they continually watch it then when it comes time for them to have sex they will think “Wow this isn’t like the videos at all, maybe I’ll just go home and use my hand that’s a lot better.” It also corrupts the way that men view women. After watching too much porn, a man starts to find women attractive based on what their body looks like, completely ignoring her personality. I believe porn is degrading to not only women but men too. It gives young kids a false sense of what a man should look like if he wants girls to find him attractive. This could lead to a feeling of depression because maybe the boy doesn’t fit the “perfect man” mold. This should not be acceptable under any circumstances.\n",
      "Denislav from Wilmington, N.C., believes pornography has taken the place of sex education:\n",
      "First, to comment on the ‘elephant in the room’, it is clearly obvious that pornography has a huge impact on society — with virtually almost all adults and teenagers being exposed to it at some point in their lives. Porn often times takes the place of traditional standardized ‘sexual education’, which frankly, is quite a flop in today’s system. Modern day sex-ed classes teach more about abstinence and the variety of STDs accompanied by sex than focusing on how to use proper protection to avoid any diseases or dangers when engaging in sexual intercourse. This kind of education does not help students to actually learn how to keep themselves safe and not do anything stupid — it’s just a mere warning telling people to ‘not do it’ whilst giving no details on safety.\n",
      "Furthermore, regarding the impact that pornography has on masculinity, femininity and relationships, I would have to say that it completely takes out the intimate aspect of the act altogether. Today’s society believes that sex is just a physical act, and nothing more. Much of the music we hear glorifies the action of intercourse and the female physique but never focuses on the relationship aspect of the subject. These messages are harmful because they provoke a message of ‘doing it just to do it’ (sounds stupid, I know) which doesn’t help people make entirely smart choices.\n",
      "Tucker  from Wilmington, N.C., suggested that health classes teach about healthy relationships, not just body parts:\n",
      "OK, let’s all take a breather before I start writing. In a way, it is just in human nature to explore what we don’t understand, and sadly sex can fall into that category. Yes, porn is bad when exposed to society, but people learn better from experience. The issue is that nobody wants to teach us about the issue. We don’t need to learn all about the urethra and tubular organs, but rather a brief explanation as to how “it” works. I find that all media has shaped not only the idea of sex but love in general. Face it, you can’t just fall in love in a session of detention or show up in your red Porsche while you swipe a girl off her heels. The real world takes time to learn what love is, believe me, I’m still learning. If we can just teach people how a healthy relationship works without having them surf the private web, if we can have more talks to teach youth before they’re sent off holding hands, just maybe we can be rid of these concepts about what love looks like from a computer screen.\n",
      "Bradly from Wilmington, N.C., proposed banning pornography to solve this problem:\n",
      "The topic of unrealistic and overstimulating sex also referred to as porn is a disgusting site that brainwashes anyone watching it into its lies and deceit. I don’t believe the vocabulary and or content of pornography has any purpose being on the free ranged internet, let alone in the minds of unpredictable teenagers. I just don’t understand why we are even debating the fact that porn influences the way teenagers think about sex, of course it does. When one is exposed to graphic material portraying a dominant man overtaking a weak female, that is exactly how teenagers will perceive sex to be in real life. In real life, women are portrayed as strong, dominant figures, not sex idols. The only solution to changing the way teenagers think about sex now is by destroying ponography and its content permanently. Doing this will not only save the present, but the many more to come in the future.\n",
      "But Zac from Wilmington, N.C., disagreed with that approach:\n",
      "Our nation’s sex education is appalling. The fact that only half of our fifty states mandate sexual education is absolutely insane. It’s no wonder teens go to porn at such an early age. Our own schools completely shut down any talk of sex during the most important time of development in adolescence. Teens everywhere are going through so many changes they don’t understand and are beginning to look at the world in different ways and our response is silence. It should be no shock to anyone that so many people were first exposed to sex through porn. I’m in no way justifying minors watching porn, but for a lot of people, it’s all they’ve got. Of course porn is impressionable on someone who has no other experience with sex. The problem is when teens only have porn. When no one is there to let them know the possible dangers of sex. When teens don’t understand that it’s bigger than just the act itself. Sex education is vital in the upbringing of any child. I think we should move away from blaming porn itself and instead see that the problem may lie within our societies education systems.\n",

      "For our Picture Prompt, “Problem,” we asked students what they thought the above image was trying to say and how it connected to current events. Here’s what they came up with:\n",
      "Tanya Bolick from North Carolina wrote:\n",
      "When I first looked at the image I was confused. After a few minutes of looking I finally came to the realizations that the cloth represents how we like to cover up our problems, and leave them for later. But the thing is, no matter how hard we try to cover up our problems, the cloth is always too thin. You can never fully cover it up or remove the problem from your life until you face it head on. If you keep putting it off you might let the problem get too big. You could leave it until it is so bad that there is no longer anything you can do about it.\n",
      "The article shows that Puerto Rico is a perfect example of this. The island is a prime hurricane location and feels the pain of it every day. After Hurricane Maria the island was greatly damaged. Due to its lack of funding, Puerto Rico’s electrical system was in bad shape and the island experienced many blackouts. After Hurricane Maria it is worse than it ever was before. Due to the lack of power during and after the hurricane the water treatment plants have not been able to do their job. Many people are still being advised to boil their water before drinking. All these problems could have been mostly avoided if we had dealt with these problems in advance, or at least as they came; the situation would not be this bad.\n",
      "Lauren Thornton from Providence, R.I., interpreted it this way:\n",
      "I think this image is shedding a light on how things in today’s society that were overlooked are now being exposed and spoken out against. From protesting against deporting Dreamers to YouTubers basically boycotting a makeup brand because they aren’t inclusive to all shades of skin, problems in our society are no longer just an at home discussion. Problems in our society are no longer being tolerated because there are so many people who have the platforms to be able to condemn them. It’s 2018 now, and we have the power to push for progress. I think this image is a sign of progress and it encourages people to speak out.\n",
      "Clay Krupp from N.C. said succinctly:\n",
      "I believe that this picture is used as a symbol that we are running out of solutions for our current event problems. The covered part symbolizes problems that have solutions or have been solved. The uncovered part symbolizes the unsolved problems in our society.\n",
      "And Ellie Hannum from Wilmington, N.C., connected it to the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla.:\n",
      "Often times the simplest art is also the most impactful. At first glance, the image portrays the fact that humans tend to deal with problems by covering them up, therefore not actually fixing the issue. The more I gazed at the image, I also noticed that the thin bandage only wraps around part of the word. This could be interpreted as only fixing or addressing part of a problem. The uncovered part of the problem is left unsolved. This image reminds me of the recent shooting that occurred in Florida this past week. To call the increasing number of school shootings in America a problem is a huge understatement. It is a nightmare that does not end for families all over the country and that our government is struggling to find a solution to. It is as if our country has a broken bone and we are trying to heal by putting a band-aid on it. We might be covering the surface of the wound but the problem still exists beneath the surface. We can’t expect to solve our country’s problems with simple solutions.\n",

      "Our Student Opinion question “Should Technology in Sports Be Limited?” drew in responses from both sides of the debate.\n",
      "Josh Failla from Wilmington, N.C., gave this compelling argument in support of technology:\n",
      "Watching the Olympics for the past week has showed how the difference between 1st and 10th place is sometimes is only 1 second. It seems that the human body has begun to peak in its ability to go faster. According to the data in the article, around 2005, times began to plateau. Times were becoming very similar, and it took a full decade to beat the speed skater record by Denis Yuskov. This shows me that technology needs to be a key part in not only speed skating, but other sports around the world.\n",
      "A competitor’s goal is to always become better, faster, and stronger. It seems nowadays that the only way athletes can improve is with the implication of technology. Technology will also influence how many people will watch the sport. Viewers don’t want to see the same speed every year, and with the implication of technology, athletes will performing better than ever, giving more awareness to the sport. If the only way that athletes can improve is through technology, then so be it. I just don’t want it to come down to robots playing the sports.\n",
      "Brennan Litzinger from Wilmington, N.C., agreed and gave an example:\n",
      "One sport that I can think of that has definitely increased its technology over the years would be football. Back when football was just becoming a sport the players only had leather helmets, I mean you might as well wear paper on your head. As a football player myself I really understand the need for technology in football. As much as we try to avoid them, head to head collisions on the field are a real thing. I believe technology has really taken a big role in preventing concussions and other injuries in football, and it has definitely changed the game.\n",
      "Nick Hargrove from Wilmington, N.C., offered a counterpoint:\n",
      "The “Peak Olympics” have arrived as seen in the graphs depicted in the interactive article. Up until around 1980 scores in the 800 meter run, high jump, and shot put all improved, until the scores plateaued in 1980. In another graph shown in the interactive article, you can see the male height in the United States showed a significant increase up until 1950. There the heights plateaued, even slightly decreasing in the 90’s. While technology may advance in the future the human performance of the Olympics has reached its peak.\n",
      "I do not think athletes should be allowed to use technology to improve their performance. Once a technology becomes crucial in order to compete at a high level, it then provides wealthier countries an advantage. Once technology provides a substantial advantage, the sport no longer is entirely about human performance and becomes about a factor that does not encourage things like dedication to the sport. Not only does it provide a disadvantage to others currently competing, it diminishes the scores and legacy of past athletes. They need to provide stricter guidelines that stay constant throughout the years so that an scores can be compared to past scores. While some may argue technology improves scores these results are inflated by something that people in the past didn’t have access to. There comes to a point where technology will be providing advantages at a level such as PED’s which are currently disallowed throughout sports.\n",
      "Hugo Veliz from Providence, R.I., also thought technology should be restricted:\n",
      "Personally, I believe that technology should be used in sports but only to improve the fairness of the game. For example, in the World Cup, they should improve the goal-line techno to truly find out if the soccer ball fully went over the line. The limits of technology in sports should be like athletes using the technology to enhance their skills to outdo their opponent unfairly.\n",
      "Kasey Kiser from Wilmington, N.C., came up with a creative solution to bolster athleticism without new technology:\n",
      "I believe we have reached “Peak Olympics”, especially in some events. Take for example skeleton or most timed events. I’ve witnessed countless runs within milliseconds of each other, making me question the appeal for that sport. Personally, I’m attracted to events where the competition doesn’t come in nitpicky ways, like how well you hugged a turn. I tend to watch the events like hockey, snowboarding, or other events where more grit, emotion, and even flaws are visible to the average viewer. I’d rather see raw athletic ability than reproducible “clones” of the sport. The plateau of times due to human limits could definitely be boosted by new technology. But like before, if you hand the entire human race a task and give them decades to refine and perfect their skills, it will eventually reach a threshold. Adding new tech may stir up the competition for a few Olympic games, but once it becomes mainstream, we’ll eventually run into the same issue.\n",
      "My solution for the Olympics introduces new modifications, or even new events entirely. Why watch the same thing every 4 years when new obstacles and challenges can be created to entertain the audience? Many might argue that changing the games will ruin the careers of athletes and trainers, along with the integrity of the sport. However, the Olympics and any competition for that matter are in the business of entertainment. If you can’t keep viewers glued to the screen, in awe of amazing competition, it’s time to switch it up.\n",
      "But Derek Han from San Jose, Calif., thinks technology will allow humans to surpass what the authors call “Peak Olympics”:\n",
      "I think that humans are not at their peak in many sports. The authors are arguing that because the difference in performance times are becoming smaller and smaller, the athletes seem to be reaching a peak performance level at which they will no longer be able to improve, or will only be able to improve through improved technology. I completely disagree with this for multiple reasons. From what I’ve seen, athletes are getting more and more skilled. For my example, I’ll use running. Specifically, the mile run. In 1855, the first recorded mile time record on a track was set, with a time of 4:28:00. That’s ridiculously slow for a professional. Even my friend can run a mile faster than that. By 1886, the mile record had dropped to 4:12:75. From 1945 to 1954, the record had been 4:01:40, until it was broken with a time of 3:59:40. From 1855 to 1954, the record has gone down by 29 seconds. Now, the record stands at 3:43:13. In 64 years, the record has gone down by 16 seconds. Between 1954 and 2018, the record has gone down by an average of four seconds per year, while between 1855 and 1954, the record has gone down by an average of 3.41 seconds. The athletes in this case are actually improving more quickly as time goes by, rather than plateauing. With the new technology that is being made, athletes aren’t getting an unfair advantage to boost their performance, athletes are actually improving the same amount as they did back in the 1850s, when track spikes were first being produced.\n",

      "Our Picture Prompt for “Valentine’s Day” brought out both the lovers and the cynics.\n",
      "Monalene Delo from Wilmington, N.C., likes what this holiday stands for:\n",
      "I love Valentine’s Day! It is the one day of the year where love, joy and cheer is spread and the focus is simply love. Often times in this world where there is so much hate, we need a reminder to be good to one another. To spread love. This holiday provides a time to support others in ways that they normally wouldn’t. For instance at school students might spend a day making valentines for friends and family. Just by making a simple card people on the receiving end feel appreciated and loved. Significant others may even go out of their way to make sure their spouses have a wonderful day, by buying candies, cards and stuffed animals. This day promotes friendships and joy. It encourages you to do something nice for others, like making a Valentine’s Day card for someone in a nursing home that may have lost their loved one. I think it is a beautiful reminder to be good to one another. Valentine’s Day is not about the materialistic things. On Valentine’s Day I saw big bears, candies and flowers lining the halls as gifts to their girlfriends, how happy it made them. Here’s the thing, flowers will die and the chocolate candies will get eaten, then what is left? When there is no more presents being given, no more cards to show how much you care. Will we still spread love and kindness? I hope that we continue to even after the day ends.\n",
      "Timosha Fesenko from Rhode Island does not:\n",
      "I remember Valentine’s Day before high school when kids were more interested in getting their sugar fix then finding a Valentine. Now? I would only take part in Valentine’s Day if I were in a relationship. If not, I don’t believe anything I’d do would be very genuine, which is the main reason I’m not a fan of Valentine’s Day. If you love someone, or want to ask them out on a date or something, why wait until Valentine’s Day? Most others are doing the exact same thing, so why not do it when no one else is?\n",
      "Jeraldyn Ramirez from Rhode Island thinks Valentine’s Day is about more than just romantic love:\n",
      "Valentine’s Day is another excuse to dress up and eat dinner. I love Valentine’s Day because it is a day for you to eat as much candy without being judged, although I eat it no matter what day it is. I don’t hate this holiday because it is just another day to show your love and appreciation for the people around you. I think the reason why many people dislike the holiday is because of the assumption that you need to be in a relationship to enjoy it. This is not the case, however, because it is just a day about love. To prove this assumption wrong, we can look at the name for Valentine’s Day in Spanish that some use to refer to it, being “Dia de la Amistad”. This means the day of friendship. I apply this definition to celebrate the holiday. I make plans with my friends and go out for a meal.\n",
      "Kerly3D from YC CLIP agreed:\n",
      "I think Valentine’s Day is a perfect day to show others how much you love them. It is not necessary to be in a relationship because you can show love to your parents, family or friends. Most people confuse this day with giving gifts and spending a lot of money, but it is not about that, a person can make happy another by sharing, treating and giving love and happiness on this day. I know some people do not agree with me, and maybe they think that we can share and give love every day, but I think it is good, at least one day, remembering with more emphasis the meaning of the love.\n",
      "But Marcelo3D from YC CLIP said it had become too commercialized:\n",
      "In my opinion, Valentine’s Day is an amazing day for the couples and for friends but I do not really care so much this day. I think that this day is a commercial day, created so that couples spend money on gifts but is not a bad day because in this day, many couples forgot their problems for one day and they concentrate on having the best day. Another thing that you can do in this day is spend time with your family and this is a good point for this day because not every day we can see all of our familiars and this is a good day to see them.\n",
      "Maddie Leber from Wilmington, N.C., noticed her feelings have changed as she has gotten older:\n",
      "I always remember loving Valentine’s Day when I was little, but let’s be honest. It was a day where everyone in your class would give you cards and candy and you barely did any work, but over the years I’ve grown to resent it. Now it’s just another day where people are walking around holding bears with hearts and chocolate prices sky-rocket. I had always believed Valentine’s Day was a day only for people in love, and if you didn’t have a significant other then you weren’t included. I’ve now realized it’s just a day to let people know you love them. This is the first year I’ve celebrated Valentine’s Day since those days in elementary school where I would give out those little cards with puppies on them that came with stickers. This year I’ve made cards for everyone in my family and plan on buying candy for my friends, but not until tomorrow, because then it’s half-off.\n",
      "And Gloria3D from YC CLIP believes love should be celebrated all year round:\n",
      "Valentine’s Day is s day for the commercial business because if you see the season in February after Christmas the sales are low. Them the commerce need to activate and what better way than create a day for in love. For you demonstrate to someone that you have any love feeling for this person not necessary have that it is this day every day, every moment you can do it. Personally I every day I say my daughters, my husband and other person during the day “I love you”, not necessary with words almost with attitudes. I give them a hug, biscuits, hot chocolate or simply you say them something beautiful. You can use this way. You do not want the commercial day for you say, “you are important for me”.\n",

      "TALLAHASSEE — Seven days after the killing of 17 students and school staff members in Florida, Republican state leaders are facing pressure unlike any they have experienced before to pass legislation addressing gun violence.\n",
      "On Wednesday, swarms of student protesters carrying signs and boxes of petitions stormed the Florida Capitol, pleading with lawmakers to pass tougher gun control in the wake of the deadly shooting at a Broward County school last week.\n",
      "On one floor, they crowded the doorway of the office of Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican and an ardent supporter of gun rights, shouting, “Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you!” On an upper floor, they gathered outside the office of the powerful speaker of the Florida House, Richard Corcoran. “Face us down! Face us down! Face us down!”\n",
      "And on the House floor, Alondra Gittelson, who survived the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, confronted Mr. Corcoran, a Republican, demanding to know why “such a destructive gun” — the AR-15 rifle — is widely accessible.\n",
      "“How is an individual in society able to acquire such a gun?” Ms. Gittelson, 16, asked Mr. Corcoran.\n",
      "Mr. Corcoran replied that he saw the rifle as a legitimate hunting weapon and did not believe a ban would help matters. “I’ll just be honest with you,” he said. “Me, personally — I don’t believe that’s the solution.”\n",
      "With about two weeks left in the legislative session, Republicans led by Mr. Scott have concluded that it would be politically catastrophic if they failed to do something to address the growing outcry. But they appear likely to pursue legislation narrower than what students are demanding, avoiding a ban on assault weapons.\n",
      "In the Florida House and Senate, lawmakers said they were involved in bipartisan efforts to craft gun-related legislative proposals that could be introduced Friday or earlier.\n",
      "State Senator Bill Galvano, a Republican, said in an interview that the Senate proposal would likely involve raising the age to purchase semiautomatic rifles to 21 from 18; introducing a three-day waiting period to purchase such guns; banning “bump stocks,” an attachment that enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster; and expanding the power of law enforcement to restrict the actions of mentally ill people under Florida’s Baker Act.\n",
      "“Nothing about this is par for the course,” Mr. Galvano said. “We’ve had one too many horrific incidents in this country and really around the world. And to have this tragedy occur here in the State of Florida has in some ways been very sobering.”\n",
      "He added that there was a “true commitment in the Senate and the House to try to address issues that would prevent something this devastating from ever happening again.”\n",
      "In addition to the students amassing in Tallahassee, Democrats in Florida have vowed to make gun control a central campaign issue in 2018, and a national gun-control group is already targeting Mr. Scott with television ads that say he neglected public safety.\n",
      "The developing clash over firearms has the potential to define Florida politics in a critical election year, thrusting the state into the center of a stalemated national debate around gun violence and the Second Amendment. In a politically divided state where the National Rifle Association has held broad influence for decades — every governor for 20 years has been an ally of the group — even fierce supporters of gun rights now believe Republicans cannot afford to seem passive in response to gruesome scenes of violence.\n",
      "The arrival of the student protesters from Stoneman Douglas, who traveled hundreds of miles by bus to the state capital, drastically raised the political stakes for Florida’s long-ruling Republicans. Having reached Tallahassee overnight, the young activists quickly set about advocating for sweeping new gun restrictions, included expanded background checks for gun purchases and an outright ban on the sale of military-style firearms.\n",
      "Inside the Capitol, the students divided into groups of 10. Senator Lauren Book, a Democrat, had helped the students arrange meetings with lawmakers in both parties, and the groups planned to meet with some 70 elected officials.\n",
      "Throughout the day, the Stoneman Douglas students moved through the labyrinthine building, and met for 20 or 30 minutes at a time with lawmakers in their offices. They crowded around small conference tables and packed onto leather couches or sat cross-legged on nubby carpets.\n",
      "Some lawmakers asked for photographs they could use for promotional materials. At least one, a Democrat, pulled students into a picture before even introducing himself.\n",
      "Group No. 6 crammed into the elevator with two parent chaperones. They met with Representative Patricia H. Williams, a Democrat, and Senator Debbie Mayfield, a Republican. Ms. Mayfield said that changes were needed, perhaps including raising the minimum age to buy powerful weapons, but she rebuffed criticism from a student, Daniel Bishop, 16, that such a change would not actually prevent deaths.\n",
      "“We can’t stop crazies,” she told the group.\n",
      "Afterward, Amanda De La Cruz, 16, looked distraught. “I want the ban on semiautomatic weapons,” she said. “I don’t care about the crazies.”\n",
      "Will Weatherford, a former speaker of the Florida House, said on Tuesday that the ferocious public response to the Parkland shooting exposed pent-up feelings of horror and fear that have mounted over time. Mr. Weatherford, a conservative Republican, said legislators might be able to move quickly on a few tailored proposals, such as raising the legal age for possessing assault rifles.\n",
      "“With Pulse, with what took place in Las Vegas, there’s been an aggregate effect,” Mr. Weatherford said, referring to the mass killings in 2016 and 2017 at an Orlando nightclub and an outdoor concert in Las Vegas. “All of it is adding up and there’s a lot of frustration that’s boiling over.”\n",
      "Mr. Weatherford said he expected the Legislature to take action of some kind, but cautioned: “It’s hard to write a thoughtful policy in three weeks.”\n",
      "Proponents of stricter gun control, however, seem unlikely to be appeased by what they perceive as half-measures. Students at the Capitol Wednesday denounced the Legislature for having voted down a proposal on Tuesday to consider banning assault weapons. “The people around us failed us,” declared Delaney Tarr, a student at Stoneman Douglas. “And if they continue to fail us, then they will no longer be in office because soon we will have the ability to vote, and we will vote them out.”\n",
      "The mood in the Capitol grew progressively more contentious throughout the day, as respectful disagreements between students and lawmakers gave way to blunt expressions of indignation by frustrated activists. By the afternoon, the Stoneman Douglas students had been joined by thousands of other Floridians, including college students, who had come to voice their support for changes to gun laws.\n",
      "The revival of gun regulation as a political issue comes at a precarious moment in Florida politics, as a polarizing president warps traditional political boundaries in a state he narrowly won in 2016. Republicans in Florida have experienced several setbacks recently in special elections, as traditionally Republican-friendly voters have deserted the party in heavily suburban and Hispanic areas. Representative Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat from the Orlando area, said voters in her largely suburban district had reached a breaking point.\n",
      "“People are angry and they’re outraged and they’re motivated,” said Ms. Murphy, who defeated an N.R.A.-backed candidate after the Pulse shooting in 2016.\n",
      "This year, control of Florida’s governorship, the State Senate, several congressional seats and a United States Senate seat are expected to be intensely contested.\n",
      "The growing pressure on Florida Republicans may reflect the changing national contours of the gun debate, which for years has been shaped chiefly by ardent supporters of the Second Amendment who vote in force. While several Democratic-leaning states, like Connecticut and Colorado, passed ambitious gun-violence laws after mass shootings, no state wholly controlled by Republicans has enacted legislation even on the comparatively modest scale currently being contemplated in Florida.\n",
      "As a matter of electoral politics, the Republican with the most at stake may be Mr. Scott, a wealthy former hospital executive who is closely aligned with the N.R.A. Mr. Scott has been moving to challenge Senator Bill Nelson, a long-serving Democrat who supports gun control, and the governor’s political allies believe passing some form of public-safety legislation is essential to his prospects in the race.\n",
      "A commercial blasting Mr. Scott for rejecting “policies that could keep Florida children safe” was released this week by Giffords, a gun control group founded by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot outside an Arizona supermarket in 2011, and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly.\n",
      "The Stoneman Douglas students saved their final meeting on Wednesday — a two-hour sit-down to which the press was not invited — with Mr. Scott. Afterward, one student, Piero Guerra, 15, said the governor had been “kind of neutral” on their proposal to ban semiautomatic rifles but had been “adamant” in support of mental health reforms.\n",
      "The meeting with the governor ended after dark, and Mr. Guerra and his classmates headed for the three buses that would take them some eight hours home to Parkland.\n",
      "Lindsey Salomone, 15, said that after a day speaking with lawmakers — she sat next to the governor during their meeting — she was ready to go home and do the real work: grieve.\n",
      "“I was in the building; my friends were shot in my class,” she said. “So emotionally, I’m pretty much in shock. I’m not feeling anything, actually.”\n",
      "She added, “But everybody is telling me: It will come.”\n",

      "This morning, I’ll be asking them what they have heard, creating opportunity to verbalize as well as acknowledge their feelings. We’ll spend some time either writing or drawing as a way to release the energy. We’ll review lockdown procedures for our school. We will do this daily.\n",
      "We also heard from Clara Green, a social emotional learning coach in Atlanta’s public schools. She sent this email to the teachers she supports:\n",
      "I am absolutely heartbroken by the horrific school shooting in Parkland, Florida. This morning, it is more critical than ever than we make students feel welcomed at school. Many of your students may come to school with strong emotions and questions and we must provide a safe space for them to cope with this traumatic event.\n",
      "In talking about this event with elementary-aged students, she and the American School Counselor Association recommend doing the following:\n",
      "• Trying to keep routines as normal as possible. Kids gain security from the predictability of routine, including attending school.\n",
      "• Limiting exposure to television and the news.\n",
      "• Being honest with kids and share with them as much information as they are developmentally able to handle.\n",

      "If there is ever even a whisper that someone has the plan to bring a gun, our teachers and students should be able to communicate freely with law enforcement so that those plans are stopped. There need to be policies that would have allowed physical intervention as soon as yesterday’s shooter posted one of the many disturbing things he did on his social media.\n",

      "Invite students to study the graphic above. What does it say about school shootings in the United States? What does that make them think and feel? Why?\n",
      "In the related article, Jugal K. Patel writes:\n",
      "More than 40 “active shooter” episodes in schools have been recorded in the United States since 2000, according to F.B.I. and news reports. Two 15-year-old students were killed and 18 more people were injured last month in a school in rural Benton, Ky. The shootings have become common enough that many schools, including Stoneman Douglas High, run annual drills in which students practice huddling in classrooms behind locked doors.\n",
      "With the Parkland shooting, three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history have come in the last five months.\n",
      "In fact, lockdown drills are now such a common feature of the school experience that a high school student who was one of the winners of our Editorial Contest last year wrote an essay, “Stopping Bullets With Locked Doors and Silence Is Already Pulling the Trigger.” In it she argues:\n",
      "It has become very familiar for high-school students to practice the infamous level-three lockdown. In all cases, we all share the semi-nervous chuckle of “wow, maybe we get Swiss-cheesed today” and sit in a corner, stare at our phones and text our friends. Only very recently, after a vivid dream — more a nightmare — of a school shooting, did I realize that sitting in the dark and stopping bullets with locked doors and silence is the exact opposite of what one would want to do. It wasn’t until I stumbled upon the fact that the “people shot and killed in the Columbine library sat there for five minutes before the shooters entered and shot them.” My school is full of able-bodied kids, and surprisingly, a great chunk that has had experience with self-defense and even marksmen training. So why sit and wait?\n",
      "Has your school been affected by gun violence? What measures do you have in place to prevent future violence, or to respond to threats? Ask students to investigate if they can’t answer that question, then discuss: Do you think your school and community are doing enough to prevent future shootings? If not, what else do you think they should do? What do you think individual students can do, if anything?\n",

      "The comments here seem so stark and brief. Understandably so, what is left to say? It is becoming so easy to see a headline like the one on this story and shrug. This is the new America. But is it? Something inside me still makes me think we have the resolve to turn this terrible tide.\n",
      "On The Learning Network, we responded to a shooting in Benton, Ky. in January by posing the question, Are We Becoming ‘Numb’ to School Shootings? It was in reaction to an article headlined, “School Shooting in Kentucky Was Nation’s 11th of Year. It Was Jan. 23.” Seventy students answered, and the question is still open to comment if your students would like to weigh in.\n",
      "Nathanie Doralus from Florida wrote:\n",
      "As a student, I agree that we’ve become numb to the news of school shootings in the United States. My high school has already had two lockdowns this school year because of students bringing guns onto the campus. It happens so often that I think many feel powerless to stop them so the default is to either ignore them or solemnly shake your head in silence. In some ways, I think it’s an attempt to not live in constant fear while attending school and receiving an education because no one should have to. But in other ways, I think some won’t take it seriously until it hits close to home. If we were taking school shootings more seriously than before, then there wouldn’t have been eleven incidents already in the first month of this year. Very few people take active assailant drills at my school seriously. I think that is just an example of denial and how it’s hard to take something seriously unless it actually happens to you or someone you know. Schools can do more than just increasing their security measures and frequently enacting drills. They can also invest in the mental health and well-being of their students and provide the support some of them need in order to prevent these acts of violence.\n",
      "And Jocelyn Savard from North Carolina shared this perspective:\n",
      "In Boston, there are a series of billboards promoting gun violence awareness. One reads “Americans killed since the massacre at Sandy Hook” and has a live count of citizen owned gun deaths displayed. I remember walking around a few years ago and being startled at the number. When Sandy Hook happened and my mom told me, I cried for days. Just a few days ago when the notifications showed up on my phone about Kentucky, I barely blinked an eye. Of course, my heart plummeted and I could feel humanity’s downfall one step closer but there was no tears, at church this weekend there was no announcement, no prayer. As a country, we have normalized school shootings so much, made books and movies out of them, make offhand comments about how that guy ‘looks like a school shooter’, that we are rapidly becoming detached to the horror that we call our home.\n",

      "...the movement to reduce gun violence seems to have a new energy, driven by students — who of course have provided much of the energy for previous political movements. Individual schools have already held or planned walkouts. A nationwide protest is scheduled for March 14, with help from organizers of the Women’s March. Teachers are also talking about mass protest, as Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick explains.\n",
      "In “A ‘Mass Shooting Generation’ Cries Out for Change,” The Times points out that teenagers today have grown up with code-red drills, and they have a perspective many adults do not:\n",
      "This is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it.\n",
      "Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 students this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices — in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman — are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting.\n",
      "While many politicians after the shooting were focused on mental health and safety, some vocal students at Stoneman Douglas High showed no reluctance in drawing attention to gun control.\n",
      "They called out politicians over Twitter, with one student telling Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, “YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND.” Shortly after the shooting, Cameron Kasky, a junior at the school, and a few friends started a “Never Again” campaign on Facebook that shared stories and perspectives from other students who survived the rampage.\n",

      "The AR-15 assault rifle, and others like it, is commonly used in mass shootings in the United States. Here's a closer look at likely reasons.\n",
      "The New York Times reports that the gunman who killed 17 people and injured others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School used an AR-15 assault rifle. This style of rifle was also used in the attacks in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex., among others.\n",

      "Advertisement\n",
      "In recent years the regulation of the sale of this style of rifle has come to the forefront of the national gun debate. In a 2017 appeal to the Connecticut Supreme Court, relatives of victims in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School argued:\n",
      "The companies that manufactured and sold the military-style assault rifle used by the gunman should be held responsible for the 2012 attack.\n",
      "A lawsuit filed by the relatives said that the AR-15-style Bushmaster used to carry out the shooting in Newtown, Conn., that killed 26 people, including 20 first graders, was specifically marketed as a weapon of war, with slogans and product placement in video games invoking the violence of combat. The lawsuit claims that such promotions were a deliberate effort to make the weapon attractive to young men, like Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman.\n",
      "At the same time, “the National Rifle Association has taken to calling the AR-15 ‘America’s rifle’” and “gun owners say that the AR-15 is used for hunting, sport shooting and self-defense.”\n",
      "Ask students: Do you think AR-15-style rifles should be more strictly regulated in the United States? Why or why not?\n",

      "But what is perhaps most heartbreaking of all is that they shouldn’t be shocking. People all over the world become furious and try to harm others, but only in the United States do we suffer such mass shootings so regularly; only in the United States do we lose one person every 15 minutes to gun violence.\n",

      "The man suspected of opening fire inside a Florida high school on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, is a former student who had been expelled for disciplinary reasons, the authorities said.\n",
      "… In the hours after the shooting, people who knew Mr. Cruz described him as a “troubled kid” who enjoyed showing off his firearms, bragging about killing animals and whose mother would resort to calling the police to have them come to their home to try to talk some sense into him. At a school with about 3,000 students, Mr. Cruz stayed to himself and had few friends but struck fear in some students with erratic behavior and an affinity for violence.\n",
      "… In the interview with the Miami news station, the student said Mr. Cruz was a junior at Stoneman Douglas High School when he was expelled last year. He said that students would joke that if anyone were to open fire inside the school, it would be Mr. Cruz. Because of that, students feared him and mostly stayed away from him, the student said.\n",

      "Senators Amy Klobuchar, Steve Daines, Dianne Feinstein and others mixed facts and falsehoods in their televised talk with President Trump. \n",
      "By Linda Qiu\n",
      "President Trump discussed potential solutions to curb gun violence on Wednesday during a televised meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers.\n",
      "The president strayed from the facts during his remarks, as The New York Times reported previously. Here is a look at the claims made during the session by other lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats — that may have strayed from the facts or otherwise require some additional context. \n",
      "In the past, Ms. Feinstein has referenced an analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston, that found the assault weapons ban drastically reduced gun massacres.\n",
      "But it’s difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to most experts and research. \n",
      "As The Times has previously reported:\n",
      "The 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the Justice Department to argue that the “ban could not be credited with any reduction in crime.” \n",
      "On the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that “the number of gun massacres fell by 37%” while the ban was in place.\n",
      "Christopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident.\n",
      "“My work is often cited in misleading ways that don’t give the full picture,” Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. “These laws can modestly reduce shootings overall” and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings.\n",
      "A database maintained by Mother Jones, a progressive magazine, shows that 95 out of 97 mass shootings from 1982 to 2018 involved male gunmen. Fifty-five were committed by white men. \n",
      "Ms. Klobuchar is probably referring to a report from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, that claims “38 percent fewer women” are “shot to death by intimate partners” in states that require background checks for all handgun sales. \n",
      "This analysis, however, does not account for other factors that contribute to domestic violence, leading other researchers to question the sweeping conclusion about background checks.\n",
      "April Zeoli, a professor at Michigan State University who studies intimate partner violence, called the Everytown estimate a “back of the napkin” calculation.\n",
      "Ms. Zeoli’s research has found that state laws restricting access to firearms for people who have been convicted of domestic violence result in declines in intimate partner homicides; specifically, 11 percent from laws that mandate buyers to get a permit whether they’re purchasing from licensed or private dealers, she said. (Other research also shows this.) \n",
      "Unlike Everytown, Ms. Zeoli also looked at state domestic violence laws, poverty and divorce rates, average amounts of public assistance, educational attainment gaps between men and women, homicides not related to domestic violence, percentage of suicides by firearms as a proxy for gun ownership rates and law enforcement availability. \n",
      "As Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Trump discussed concealed-carry laws, Mr. Trump said, “You’re not allowed concealed in a gun-free zone.” The exchange highlights how amorphous the term “gun-free zone” has become.\n",
      "Federal law prohibits firearms in grade schools, but makes explicit exceptions for security personnel and instructional purposes (hunting classes, for example). So, Mr. Rutherford is wrong to state that there are never guns in “gun-free zones.” \n",
      "Furthermore, at least eight states allow concealed carry for teachers at grade schools, and two others have eased restrictions, according to the Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy group. \n",
      "Private businesses may also ban civilian use of firearms on their premises, but state laws vary on how and on the extent to which a business can opt out.\n",
      "Texas has very specific requirements for the signs businesses put up to indicate that they do not allow firearms on their properties. (For example, they must be in both English and Spanish.) North Carolina requires signs to be “conspicuous,” while Florida has no explicit rules. Florida is one of 23 states that require business owners to allow guns in cars parked on company property.\n",
      "When asked what data Mr. Scalise was referring to, a spokesman told The Times, “Since the early ’90s, the significant increase in the issuance of concealed-carry permits by states has been accompanied by a significant drop in violent crime rates — and that includes millions of new permits being issued in the last decade or so.” \n",
      "The spokesman cited the work of John R. Lott Jr., an economist and gun rights advocate whose book “More Guns, Less Crime” makes the case that “passing concealed-handgun laws deters violent crime.” But Mr. Lott’s findings have been questioned by other academics. \n",
      "In 2005, a panel at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded that “no link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data, even in the initial sample.” \n",
      "Other researchers have reached an opposite conclusion. In a 2017 study, John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School, found that states that adopted right-to-carry laws saw an increase in violent crime. \n",

      "A child is shot to death. Maybe at school, maybe at the movies. It is all over TV, all over Twitter, just like the last mass shooting.\n",
      "Then the cameras go away, and the parents are left in a wilderness of heartbreak. They do not know how to plan a funeral, where to get a therapist. They’re not aware that scammers will try to fund-raise off their grief, that conspiracy theorists will question their tragedy, or that — hard to believe — they might, eventually, be O.K.\n",
      "But lots of people do know.\n",
      "“When we had this happen to us, had our daughter slaughtered, we didn’t know what to do, or what was going to happen next,” said Sandy Phillips, whose 24-year-old daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was one of the 12 killed in the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., in 2012. “We didn’t want to live. It was horrific. And nobody else understood, except other survivors.”\n",
      "So it is that Ms. Phillips and her husband, Lonnie Phillips, are raising money to travel to Parkland, Fla., where the Phillipses will quietly let the families of 17 of America’s latest victims of mass gun violence  know that they are there to listen, to advise, to hug, to cry, and, perhaps, to recruit them to the ranks of the most committed gun-control activists in the country.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The mass shootings of recent years, the proliferation of grief from rural Oregon to the tip of Florida, have forced hundreds of family members into an unwanted fellowship. Veterans like the Phillipses serve as guides in the immediate aftermath, introducing the bereaved of Sandy Hook to those of San Bernardino and the parents of Virginia Tech to those of Roseburg, in a loose but growing network.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Some mourn in private. Some confront politicians, join gun-control groups and flock to rallies. But whether they turn to advocacy or not, many gravitate toward one another, checking on each other by Facebook or phone whenever another gunman strikes.\n",
      "In a gun-control debate that often splinters along ideological lines, no one speaks more powerfully than those who survived a high-profile shooting, or the families of those who did not. The power of their testimonials goes beyond their authenticity: They, unlike politicians and advocates, can usually avoid the accusation that they are politicizing a tragedy.\n",
      "Recognizing the emotional heft of such stories, groups like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence  and Everytown for Gun Safety often make themselves available to survivors and victims’ families in the aftermath of mass shootings, sometimes even paying for them to travel to meet other survivors and advocates or to attend rallies, hearings and meetings with politicians. Everytown, the group founded and funded by the former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, runs a network of about 1,500 family members and shooting survivors who are trained in activism, including many who were affected not by mass shootings but by the smaller ones that occur daily.\n",
      "They join a long tradition of families who have turned private heartbreak into public advocacy. There is Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which has successfully shifted public awareness around drunken driving and pushed for tougher laws. There is John Walsh, who became a well-known anti-crime TV personality after his son was kidnapped and killed. There are the parents of people killed by undocumented immigrants, who have seen their campaign against illegal immigration taken up by President Trump.\n",
      "The difference is that mass-shooting survivors have yet to win any major victories on the federal level. So they do what they can, hoping that when the next mass shooting happens, more people will take to their cause.\n",
      "“The more people that are affected in some way, the more people care; yeah, that’s what it’s going to take,” said Jenna Yuille, whose 54-year-old mother, Cindy Yuille, was one of two people shot and killed at the Clackamas Town Center outside Portland, Ore., in December 2012. “It’s horrible, but that’s part of what it’s going to take.”\n",
      "Ms. Yuille’s mother died three days before the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 26 people were killed, 20 of them first graders. The gun-control debate was suddenly everywhere, and Ms. Yuille, encouraged by a friend, began to speak up. She testified in support of background-check legislation in Oregon and got involved with the Everytown Survivor Network. Ms. Yuille now works for Americans for Responsible Solutions, an advocacy group founded by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot outside an Arizona supermarket in 2011, and her husband, the retired astronaut, Capt. Mark E. Kelly.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "At an Everytown training event in the spring of 2015, Ms. Yuille met Erica Lafferty, the daughter of one of the Newtown victims, Dawn Hochsprung, Sandy Hook’s principal. They were around the same age; their mothers had died three days apart. The connection was instantaneous.\n",
      "When they heard about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday — Ms. Yuille in a text from her boyfriend, Ms. Lafferty when she glanced at CNN — Ms. Yuille texted Ms. Lafferty to check on her.\n",
      "They felt the same, they said: Tired.\n",
      "“Is it bad that we’re feeling so numb? Is it bad that I haven’t cried?” Ms. Lafferty asked Ms. Yuille on Friday, during a joint interview. “Because I haven’t.”\n",
      "“Same,” said Ms. Yuille, 29. “I know there are other people, especially in Oregon, that see me as a leader on this issue, and being a spokesperson on this issue, so I worry about that. I don’t want to let people down.”\n",
      "“Exactly,” said Ms. Lafferty, 32, who works for Everytown. “Like, if I slow down, am I going to disappoint anyone? Am I going to disappoint myself?”\n",
      "Many families, of course, do not want to be the faces of anything. They want to struggle in quiet, if not quite in peace. Some of the families of the Newtown victims have never spoken publicly about their ordeal. And some family members, Ms. Phillips said, continue to support gun rights.\n",
      "Soon after the Sandy Hook shooting, Mark Mattioli, whose son James was killed at the school, testified that legislators should focus on mental health support instead of gun control. He also spoke at a National Rifle Association news conference to praise the group’s school safety proposals.\n",
      "But a large and growing number of families who want gun laws strengthened have chosen to seize the platform the media offers in the wake of a shooting and never to relinquish it. One man who lost his son in the Columbine High School shooting almost two decades ago, Tom Mauser, is still deeply involved in gun-control efforts in Colorado.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“People who are affected in a personal way become lifelong dedicated volunteers to this,” said Robert Bowers Disney, the vice president for organizing at the Brady Campaign. “It just fundamentally changes people’s lives and experiences.”\n",
      "The Phillipses have been to the scene of almost every major shooting since their daughter died, usually letting local authorities and charitable organizations know that they are there if families need them. In Florida, they are planning to offer to connect the families of the teachers killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to the daughter of a teacher killed at Columbine in 1999.\n",
      "“They may not be wanting to talk, but when you tell them, ‘I lost my daughter in the Aurora theater massacre,’ they’re like, ‘Oh … my God,’” Ms. Phillips said. “It’s that initial, ‘Oh, you get this.’”\n",

      "The Trump administration acted in bad faith last year when it suggested that cities with corrupt police departments could fix the problem without federal oversight and when it tried to derail a police reform agreement that Baltimore had negotiated with the federal government in the waning days of the Obama administration.\n",
      "The argument that Baltimore might be able to remake its grotesquely corrupt Police Department without federal help was blown apart last Monday, when a federal jury convicted two detectives of robbery and racketeering charges in a trial that has exposed pervasive corruption in the department.\n",
      "The city’s elite Gun Trace Task Force has been gripped by a conspiracy in which officers covered for one another as they stole property, narcotics and money from people, some of whom had committed no crimes and had earned the money lawfully. In addition, the officers filed false reports that allowed some to pilfer vast amounts of overtime, doubling their salaries, and those who were convicted testified to seizing weapons that were subsequently sold on the street — a cardinal outrage in a city wracked by gun violence.\n",
      "Monday’s convictions follow guilty pleas by six other officers in connection with the case, and as The Baltimore Sun reported last week, the officers and other witnesses have now implicated a dozen additional colleagues, so more charges could be in the offing.\n",
      "What makes the guilty officers’ conduct particularly brazen is that much of it occurred during a separate federal investigation into police practices, an inquiry begun in the wake of the protests and rioting that followed the death of Freddie Gray, a young African-American man who died of a broken spine suffered in police custody in 2015.\n",
      "That investigation revealed an abusive form of policing, vindicating black Baltimoreans who had complained for years that they were being stopped, frisked and even arrested without cause. These practices destroyed public confidence in law enforcement, paving the way for the fiery outrage that followed Mr. Gray’s death.\n",
      "Congress had cases like this one in mind in 1994 when it gave the Justice Department the authority to restructure troubled police departments that were clearly unable of root out corruption and brutality on their own. Using this authority, the Obama Justice Department negotiated a sweeping agreement that requires Baltimore to undertake a wide range of reforms, including better training and technology, community oversight and transparency measures.\n",
      "A federal judge last year rejected the Trump Justice Department’s attempt to delay court approval of the agreement, known as a consent decree, which the city’s civic leaders say is absolutely essential to overhauling a police department that has a longstanding reputation for abusing the people it is meant to protect — and that has failed, at every level, to contain lawlessness in the ranks that should have been visible to everyone in charge.\n",
      "The monitor who was appointed by the court to determine if and when Baltimore has fulfilled the terms of the consent decree needs to keep those failures foremost in mind.\n",

      "I don’t know if you heard, but this week a boy with a handgun killed two of his fellow students at a high school in Kentucky.\n",
      "“It is unbelievable that this would happen in a small, close-knit community like Marshall County,” said the governor, Matt Bevin.\n",
      "Actually, that part is completely believable. Given that another school shooting this week was in Italy, Tex., population under 2,000. And that two months ago, 25 people were shot to death while attending church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., population 362.\n",
      "It’s about guns, not population density. And it is a huge story. But I know, people, you have been beating your heads against the wall about this issue forever, and a certain numbness creeps in. “You had the worst mass shooting in the country in Las Vegas, followed by a really horrific event in a church. People just get worn out,” said Mark Kelly, who co-founded a gun-safety organization with his wife, then-Representative Gabby Giffords, after she was shot in the head while meeting with her constituents.\n",
      "Donald Trump — who yelled about “carnage” in big cities during his inauguration speech — has said not a word about the Kentucky shooting except to tweet his “thoughts and prayers.” (Even that, commenters noted, came nearly 24 hours after the prime minister of Canada sent his sympathies.) It is highly unlikely this lack of focus was due to weariness. “You’ve got to wonder,” Kelly said in a phone interview, whether the president would have had a more intense reaction if the news reports suggested “the shooter was of a different ethnicity.”\n",
      "True that. During his government-shutdown-immigration rants, Trump kept pointing out that the man who killed eight people with a truck in Manhattan had come to the country through a visa lottery system. That happened on Oct. 31. Since that time, 73 people have been killed in mass shootings in this country. But about gun regulation we have not heard a presidential peep.\n",
      "The unusual thing about that terrible Manhattan tragedy is that it was not committed with a gun. Depending on how you count them, we’ve had around 30 acts of terrorism since 9/11 that involved multiple deaths. More than half were committed by right-wing extremists (think Charleston church shooting). And virtually all of them were gun violence.\n",
      "So, this is the time when we talk about gun regulation. Come on. Energize.\n",
      "We are resigned to the fact that there is nothing, no matter how horrific, that will convince any politician in the thrall of the National Rifle Association to consider even the most modest gun-safety legislation. After the Las Vegas massacre, in which the murderer had purchased at least 55 weapons in the year leading up to the shooting, Kentucky’s Governor Bevin seemed to feel the most unbelievable part was the call by “political opportunists … for more gun regs.” He tweeted: “You can’t regulate evil…”\n",
      "Maybe not, but you can definitely try to disarm evil. A super-modest bill banning bump stocks — the device the Las Vegas killer used to turn the semiautomatic rifles he could buy legally into functional machine guns — was introduced in Congress and then shuffled away. Las Vegas can’t ban bump stocks since there’s a state law prohibiting municipalities from doing that kind of thing on their own. Nevada is very strict about this, although not nearly as strict as Kentucky, which makes elected officials criminally liable for passing gun-safety laws.\n",
      "Another super-modest bipartisan bill aimed at beefing up the background check system was introduced after the church shooting in Texas, in which the mass murderer never should have been cleared to buy a gun, even under the stupendously lenient American system. And nothing has happened.\n",
      "“It’s a little stuck,” said Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the co-sponsors.\n",
      "Trump’s call for action after the Sutherland Springs church shooting was limited to one tweet. (“May God be w/ the people … The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene.”) Nine days later, when a man with a history of mental illness and a semiautomatic rifle crashed through the gates of the tiny four-classroom elementary school in Rancho Tehama, Calif., spraying bullets, there was no mention at all. Some people suspect Trump would not express any concern about California if the entire state cracked off and fell into the sea.\n",
      "Meanwhile, our president is running a re-election campaign ad (“Oh God,” moaned the nation) which announces that “Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants.” Do you think he feels responsible for the 15,583 gun violence deaths — suicides not included — that occurred during the first year he was president?\n",
      "The good news — you needed some, right? — is that the gun-safety advocates are not worn out. “Every great social change movement had moments where you had to convince yourself not to give up,” said Senator Murphy.\n",
      "If they keep at it, someday we’ll get a new president who doesn’t believe the only answer to mass shootings in public schools is an occasional tweet about thoughts and prayers.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — With hundreds of high school students massed at the Capitol to demand gun control, the House instead approved modest legislation on Wednesday to beef up school security without changes to the nation’s gun laws, hoping to answer demands for action a month after the massacre in Parkland, Fla.\n",
      "Across Capitol Hill, a top F.B.I. official conceded in Senate testimony that his agency had made mistakes in failing to follow up on tips about the gunman.\n",
      "“We clearly should have done more,” David L. Bowdich, the acting deputy director of the F.B.I., told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said the bureau was doubling the number of supervisors assigned to review tips from the public.\n",
      "The House vote and the Senate hearing came as students across the country  walked out of their classes to demand tougher gun laws after the rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Hundreds rallied in front of the White House and at the Capitol, cheered on by congressional Democratic leaders.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But the school safety bill had no provisions relating to guns, and the Senate hearing was focused on law enforcement failures. Gun control advocates said neither addressed what they saw as the real problem: the proliferation of high-powered firearms used in mass shootings, not only at schools but at concerts, churches, movie theaters and other public places.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The House measure, which passed 407 to 10 as dozens of students looked down from the visitors’ gallery, is one of a flurry of school safety bills that have been introduced in Congress — without curbs on guns.\n",
      "It authorizes $500 million over 10 years for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous tip lines to detect threats. The money could also be used for physical improvements, such as metal detectors, but at the insistence of Democrats, a provision was added that bars the money from being used to arm teachers.\n",
      "Known as the STOP School Violence Act, the bill was sponsored by Representative John Rutherford, a Republican and former sheriff of Jacksonville, Fla., who called it “an important first step towards keeping our students and our teachers safe.”\n",
      "White House officials have said President Trump supports the measure; a similar one has been introduced in the Senate.\n",
      "But Democrats lamented that it did not go far enough.\n",
      "“The bill is fine as far as it goes, and we should certainly do more to make our schools safer,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York. “But it is shameful that we must do so because of our failure to reduce the threat of gun violence to children.”\n",

      "On the Senate side of the Capitol, Mr. Bowdich, of the F.B.I., suffered a grilling from Judiciary Committee members about the bureau’s failure to follow up on at least two credible tips related to the Parkland gunman, Nikolas Cruz.\n",
      "The first tip, in September, came via email, from a bail bondsman in Mississippi who spotted a suspicious comment on a YouTube channel by a “nikolas cruz” who said he intended to become “a professional school shooter.” The second came in January from a woman who called the agency’s tip line and said, “I know he’s going to explode.”\n",
      "“In my judgment we have seen a catastrophic and systemic failure of law enforcement at every level,” Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said, before asking Mr. Bowdich if he believed that the F.B.I. “had committed serious, grave errors.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Mr. Bowdich’s reply was succinct: “Yes, sir, I do.”\n",
      "The committee also heard emotional testimony from Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina was among the 17 people killed at Stoneman Douglas High School, and Katherine Posada, a language arts teacher at the school.\n",
      "“Nikolas Cruz and the danger that he posed were the worst kept secret in Parkland,” Mr. Petty said.\n",
      "Ms. Posada chided lawmakers for what was an apparent partisan divide, with Republicans confining their questions to law enforcement issues and Democrats using the session to put a spotlight on gun control.\n",
      "“This is not a partisan issue,” the teacher said. “The children of Republicans can fall victim to bullets.”\n",

      "School gun violence and the terror it creates have riveted America again since a gunman shot and killed 17 last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The public outrage has produced a new wave of protests, including walkouts in schools across the country on Wednesday.\n",
      "But acts of violence aren’t the only source of school terror.\n",
      "For each heinous attack successfully carried out, there have been many more scores of threats in schools across the country. And while thankfully no one dies because of a threat, fake or foiled attacks can be terrifying, too. \n",
      "After the Parkland attack, we reached out to students across the country, asking them to tell us about threats their schools have received. We heard from more than 100 teenagers, some describing hiding in dark closets and classrooms, sometimes for hours, as they braced for an attack.\n",
      "In the five months from August to December 2017, there were at least 671 bomb or gun threats — or both — directed at American schools, according to the Educators School Safety Network, a nonprofit that provides school safety training. In the past month, since the Parkland shooting, there have been more than 465 bomb or gun threats or both. \n",
      "Here is a selection of the student responses, condensed and edited for clarity. We have corroborated each threat by reviewing local news reports and, in some cases, contacting the teenagers’ school districts and classmates.\n",
      "Winifred Chung, 18, is a freshman at the University of California, Berkeley, but was a senior at Westview High School in San Diego when her school was threatened last March. No gun was found, according to news reports. \n",
      "I was sitting in Physics last year when suddenly, we heard, “This is a lockdown, this is NOT a drill.” We calmly crawled under the desks, not thinking too much of it. And then rumors started flying on social media. \n",
      "The general conclusion was that someone had a gun in their backpack, and that a kid saw and reported it. The thought of a possible shooting made me nauseous. \n",
      "Our substitute teacher could not figure out how to lock the doors. Kids started making jokes out of the situation, and we were instructed to put our phones away. All I could think was, “I can’t believe my biggest fear could possibly come true in this moment.” I texted my parents that I loved them. \n",
      "Alice Meyer, 16, is a junior at High Tech High School, in North Bergen, N.J. She was on campus when her school received this threat in September. \n",
      "The police were looking for someone they believed had a gun. Our whole school was put on lockdown, no one was sure what was happening. We had no idea if our school was being shot up or if everything was fine. \n",
      "I thought my school’s name would be the next one in the headlines, that my friends would be among the dead and wounded. We were in the dark, hiding under desks, terrified of what would happen next. No gun was found, but that hour and a half was so beyond chaotic and terrifying. \n",
      "Kathryn Ikeda, 18, is a senior at Johnston High School, in Johnston, Iowa. Her school received this threat in October. \n",
      "The Dark Overlord hacking group got personal information for almost every student in the district, including our addresses and parents’ phone numbers. They texted numerous parents, threatening to shoot up our schools. \n",
      "As a result, school was canceled for one whole day while the threat was investigated, and delayed on the second day to allow time for security sweeps. It’s chilling to think how easily something like that could be orchestrated in my community.\n",
      "Rachael Lombardo, 18, is a senior at Upper Darby High School in Drexel Hill, Pa. In October 2014, when she was a freshman, her school received this threat.\n",
      "While a shooting has not occurred at my school, there have been threats of gun violence, and it’s almost become normal — even expected. My freshman year someone threatened to pull the fire alarm as a ploy to get students out of the building to shoot them. \n",
      "I was terrified to go to school that day but my parents believed there was nothing to worry about, and while I trusted them, they didn’t feel what I felt. What they didn’t feel was the eerie silence that carried throughout the day while students breathed quietly, waiting for the ring of the fire alarm. \n",
      "Instead of focusing on my biology work, I was thinking about how I would hide and where I could exit the building discreetly. Certainly, this is not what a 14-year-old high school freshman should be forced to think about. \n",
      "Lily Powell Fagerlund, 18, is a senior at Ballard High School, in Seattle. The threat she describes came in November 2015, when she was a sophomore.\n",
      "Multiple times, there has been either the possibility of someone having brought a gun or actually bringing one to school. \n",
      "The first time, I was in a lockdown for several hours and a kid was arrested down the street for bringing a gun to school. A weapon was never found. However, many people in my class, including me, were hiding in a closet, while many didn’t take it seriously and kept doing their schoolwork. \n",
      "Soon we started to see giant SWAT teams with giant guns outside our windows and we knew that something serious had happened. I remember people crying and yelling at others to be quiet. It was chaotic. \n",
      "Ruth Schultz, 17, is a senior at Princeton High School, in Princeton, N.J. Her school received this threat in May 2015, when she was a freshman.\n",
      "During my 8th grade and freshman years, various schools in my district received swatting calls periodically. When they called one school in the district, that school would go into lockdown and the rest would “shelter in place.” \n",
      "It happened so often during my freshman year that, eventually, we barely paid attention when we were ordered to shelter in place, until one day our school received the threat. We went into lockdown, and everyone was scared. I remember very vividly thinking, If this is the end of my life, that’s tragic, but there’s nothing I can do about it.\n",
      "Noah Carroll-Promes, 18, is a freshman at Folsom Lake College, in Folsom, Calif., but was a student at Ponderosa High School, in Shingle Springs, Calif., when his school received threats. \n",
      "We have never had a shooting at our school, however we have had an individual walk onto campus with a gun.  We have also had threats on numerous occasions, mainly around the time final exams roll around — kids want to get out of taking finals and enjoy seeing the reaction they can elicit from the school. \n",
      "George Lewis, 17, is a senior at Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park, Illinois. Last October, his homecoming dance was the target of a threat.\n",
      "A shooting has never occurred at my school, but we received a threat before our homecoming dance and there was heavy police presence at the dance. \n",
      "Emmet White, 17, is a senior at Grant High School in Portland, Ore. His school received a couple of threats in 2015 and then again in October. \n",
      "During my sophomore year, we had a lockdown because of reports from passing drivers that two visibly armed men were walking down the street, toward the school, carrying high capacity rifles. \n",
      "This year, my senior year, we relocated to a school in a different neighborhood while our original school is being rebuilt. One day, we heard a rapid succession of gunshots from an adjacent street. We went into lockdown, but the source of the gunfire was never found.\n",
      "Adrian Doan, 17, is a junior at Grosse Pointe South High School in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich. In October 2016, his school was put on lockdown after a student claimed to have a weapon. \n",
      "When we have been put into a lockdown because of the slightest threat, I get a horrible feeling — like what if this is real and these are my last moments on Earth? It almost sounds cliché, but I have truly wondered at all the things I’d never experience if I died at that moment. I cannot imagine how much more traumatizing an actual event would be. \n",
      "Emma Choi, 18, is a senior at George C. Marshall High School, in Falls Church, Va. In March 2016, her school received an emailed threat. \n",
      "A lot of us think that we’re invincible, that the things that happen on the news take place in a world separate from our own. But there was a period when a bunch of schools in my county were receiving bomb threats from a robotic caller. Our school received one via email. My parents got an email from the school about it and were assured that the threat wasn’t serious. Most of us students didn’t know about it until we got home. \n",

      "As thousands of students walked out of their schools on Wednesday to pressure Congress to approve gun control legislation, three other students were healing from wounds inflicted when a teacher’s firearm accidentally discharged in a California classroom.\n",
      "The teacher, Dennis Alexander, who is also a city councilman in Seaside, Calif., was showing the students a gun on Tuesday during his advanced public safety class at Seaside High School when the gun accidentally went off, Marci McFadden, a spokeswoman for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District, said in a phone interview on Wednesday.\n",
      "Mr. Alexander was pointing his gun at the ceiling when it fired, she said, causing pieces of the ceiling to fall to the floor. Ms. McFadden said that California law and district policy prohibit teachers from bringing guns on campus.\n",
      "Cmdr. Nick Borges of the Seaside Police Department said in an email on Wednesday that nobody suffered serious injuries, however, a piece of bullet shrapnel ricocheted and hit one 17-year-old on the neck, and two other students were also hit by debris.\n",

      "When asked why the parents had not been informed about the accident, Ms. McFadden said she could not comment because the matter was under investigation.\n",
      "Mr. Alexander’s class, which includes 32 juniors and seniors, has been offered for a couple of years as one of the school’s career technical education offerings, Ms. McFadden said. She said she did not know whether students are normally shown guns during the class.\n",
      "Mr. Alexander was placed on administrative leave at both Seaside High School and the Sand City Police Department, where he works about four hours a week as a reserve police officer whenever the department is short-handed, Sand City Police Chief Brian Ferrante said in a phone interview on Wednesday.\n",

      "By Sam Quinones\n",
      "The United States is in the midst of at least two plagues with much in common.\n",
      "One is gun-fueled mass murder; the other is addiction to opioids — pain pills, heroin, fentanyl.\n",
      "Both are uniquely American afflictions, killing in alarming numbers. Both are revved in part by commercial interests and in part by the collapse of community in American culture. Both persist because of the erroneous belief that there’s an easy answer to these complicated problems.\n",
      "Above all, both are about supply.\n",
      "Laid on top of a culture of increasing social isolation for many, our vast supply of easily accessible opioids has sent overdose deaths skyrocketing. So, too, a vast supply of easily accessible guns has produced a similarly rising death toll.\n",
      "I wrote a book about our opioid-addiction epidemic. I first thought the book was about drug marketing — both from pharmaceutical companies and from Mexican heroin traffickers. But it was bigger than that; it was about who we were as Americans. The root of the scourge, I believe, is in isolation and a conviction that we are entitled to a life free of pain — all of which forms heroin’s natural habitat.\n",
      "We exalted the private, the individual, at the expense of community. We once played kick the can in the streets until late on summer evenings. Now those streets are empty as we huddle at home. More than 12 percent of the population served in the military during World War II, and nearly every American sacrificed to beat the Nazis. Today, less than 1 percent join the armed services. Kids are dosed with weeks’ worth of narcotics to keep them from the three days of pain that accompany a wisdom-tooth extraction. We’ve seen parents prosecuted for letting their kids go to the park alone. College students wilt when exposed to ideas they disagree with, and 24-hour cable news shrieks at us, forcing us into ideological bubbles.\n",
      "All of this has provided fertile soil for a two-decade dosing with opioids — promoted by drug companies, prescribed by doctors, demanded by many of us — that led a national explosion of addiction and death.\n",
      "I was a newspaper reporter for almost 30 years before writing that book. I covered seven mass murders — six involving guns. I was in Tucson after Jared Loughner shot 19 people, six of whom died, including a federal judge; among the wounded was Gabrielle Giffords, a member of the House of Representatives at the time. Over the phone, I covered the shootings at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.\n",
      "Long before all that, I covered perhaps the first school shooting of our era of gun massacres — in Stockton, Calif., in 1989. I was the crime reporter for The Stockton Record when a loner with an AK-47 opened fire on a playground full of children at recess at Cleveland Elementary School. Five of them died; some 30 others were wounded.\n",
      "My job was to find out as much about each assailant as possible. As years passed, I realized I was telling the same story over and over — a lost, isolated, unbalanced (usually white) young man with legal access to firearms.\n",
      "Now, Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged with the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, has taken his place among those lost boys, all products of our searing American isolation and ready supply of guns.\n",
      "I learned writing my book that when you unleash a vast new supply of potent legal drugs on a population as bereft of community as ours, the consequences are painful, enduring and nationwide. Enormous supply creates enormous abuse.\n",
      "That’s the lesson we should take from our gun scourge as well.\n",
      "It’s not just that each gunman procured these weapons legally, but that our supply is so immense that finding a gun — legally or not — is easy. Mass shootings plague us, but so does a decades-old torment of gun violence and suicide.\n",
      "Most gun owners are law abiding, just as many people have no trouble taking narcotic painkillers according to the prescribed instructions. Yet when guns, or opioids, are accessible in plentiful supply to everyone, without much monitoring of consumers’ backgrounds, and are then mixed with the isolation and disconnection in American culture today, havoc results.\n",
      "The end to our opioid addiction epidemic, I believe, will come from a symphony of small solutions, many of them unsexy: expanding treatment options, using jails as recovery centers, creating syringe exchanges, broadening the use of Narcan and widening the curriculums in medical schools to include pain and addiction studies. Law enforcement’s role is crucial. Recovering addicts need supply reduced. The supply of opioids on our streets is so vast and potent that when a recovering addict relapses, the result is often death. Insurance companies, meanwhile, need to reimburse for non-opioid pain treatment, as they once did. Up to now, we’ve lowered pain pill prescribing but without raising the numbers of pain strategies available for chronic-pain patients, and for which doctors are trained. Those patients thus turn to the black market for pills, but also for heroin and fentanyl, the supply of which is booming.\n",
      "All this, in other words, is a community approach to a plague feeding on our isolation.\n",
      "Mass murder calls for the same.\n",
      "Restoring the ban on assault rifles is essential, as is banning gun ownership among people convicted of domestic abuse, those with domestic abuse restraining orders, and the mentally ill. So is banning gun possession among those repeatedly convicted of driving while intoxicated. We need to change the law to let the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study gun violence as a public health issue. We need longer prison terms for stealing a gun or possessing one that’s stolen; possessing a stolen gun has very different potential consequences from possessing a stolen X-Box.\n",
      "The problem is, both the opioid epidemic and mass murder are bedeviled by our isolation. Some treatment advocates, stung by the war on drugs, won’t recognize law enforcement’s necessary role in our attack on addiction as a robust player in a multipronged approach. The Republican Party — which understands that an enormous opioid supply fuels our addiction scourge — fails, or doesn’t want, to understand that the supply of firearms is at the root of our problem of mass shootings. Moreover, the party’s response to each horror, apart from the by-now rote “thoughts and prayers,” has been the claim that this or that proposed reform wouldn’t have stopped the shooter. If one grand and easy answer wouldn’t have saved the day then we’re narcotized to inaction.\n",
      "To get beyond all that, we must again act as bold, resilient Americans, tackling a problem with a can-do attitude. We must stop believing in one easy answer to complicated problems, and shamefully giving up when one doesn’t magically appear.\n",
      "Those attitudes are just more symptoms of our culture of isolation, in which we’ve lost the habit of collaborating with our neighbors. And that, in turn, is the natural habitat not just of heroin but of that next young killer now planning to roam a school corridor.\n",

      "\n",
      "Four members of a Brooklyn family, including a toddler and a teenage boy, were found shot to death early Wednesday morning, their bodies scattered throughout a three-bedroom apartment along with bullet casings and a gun, in what the police said appeared to be a triple murder-suicide.\n",
      "The toddler’s grandmother returned home to her Brownsville apartment around 5 a.m. and called 911 after discovering the bodies. They all had gunshot wounds to the head.\n",
      "Detectives’ leading theory was that the gunman was the toddler’s 27-year-old father, Terrance Briggs, whose body was found between a bed and a wall in the same room as his young daughter, Laylay Briggs, 1.\n",
      "The grandmother found the door locked when she arrived, and there were no signs of a forced entry, the police said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But police officials said that any possible motive was not yet clear, and detectives would need to perform a detailed crime scene review, a detailed forensic review of the wounds and interviews with relatives and neighbors before piecing together what happened.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The body of Mr. Briggs’s stepfather, identified by the police as Loyd Drain Jr., 57, was found in the bathroom. And the body of Mr. Drain’s son, identified by his school as Loyed Drain III, 16, was found in a back bedroom.\n",
      "They were all pronounced dead at the scene, a fourth-floor apartment at 345 Thatford Avenue that is part of the Riverdale Osborne Towers, a high-rise complex in the heart of the Brownsville neighborhood.\n",
      "The shootings, discovered on a day students were holding nationwide protests over gun violence, underscored the heightened risk of deadly domestic violence in situations with a gun. The police had been called to the Brownsville apartment multiple times for domestic incidents in the past, a spokesman said, though it was not clear who the target of those complaints was or how they were resolved.\n",
      "Domestic murders fell last year in New York City, to 49 from 63 the year before, and police officials said fewer than 10 of the killings last year were by gunfire.\n",
      "In the early hours of the Brownsville case, detectives were looking for the gun under Mr. Briggs’s body, having determined that there was no gun near the other family members. But they were cautious at first about moving Mr. Briggs’s body, and police officials declined to answer questions later about where detectives ultimately found the gun.\n",
      "“There’s reasons we can’t say,” Deputy Chief Michael Kemper, the commanding officer of Brooklyn North detectives, told a reporter.\n",
      "The shell casings appeared to come from .40-caliber bullets, the police said.\n",
      "Relatives and friends of the family, gathering to grieve at another home in Brooklyn, declined to speak about what happened, and much was still unclear about what led up to the shootings — and even when precisely they happened.\n",

      "Some neighbors said the family argued, particularly Mr. Briggs and his stepfather, Mr. Drain, but they said nothing ever raised an alarm. Some neighbors also said Mr. Briggs was known to be troubled. He particularly liked to play the first-person shooter video game “Call of Duty” on his PlayStation, one person said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Still, other neighbors said the family was friendly and welcoming.\n",
      "“This is a shocking thing to me,” said James Walker, who lived on the opposite end of the floor from the family. “They were friendly people — nothing bad about them.”\n",
      "The elder Mr. Drain, who went by “Big Daddy,” held cookouts across from the complex on the outskirts of Nehemiah Park. He used to sit by an old blue van of his, grilling and holding forth with neighbors.\n",
      "“He would be there all summer long feeding everbody’s kids,” said Kathy Lindo, who lives down the hall from the family.\n",
      "The younger Mr. Drain, a junior at Uncommon Collegiate Charter High School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, was taking five Advanced Placement classes in calculus, English, environmental science, United States history and research and communication. He was also a student leader of the school’s cooking club, said Barbara Martinez, a school spokeswoman.\n",
      "A friend said he used to play third base for a summer baseball team, the Brooklyn Bombers, and also excelled at basketball.\n",
      "“Our school community is devastated by this senseless loss of human life,” Ms. Martinez said. “We are grieving and ensuring that our students and staff have access to counseling at this difficult time.”\n",
      "Ms. Lindo said she was puzzled she did not hear any gunshots Wednesday morning. The first hint something was wrong was when her husband looked out the window and saw the police going in and out of the building. Then she looked down and saw the grandmother, Patricia Green, being helped out by the police.\n",
      "“She could barely walk,” Ms. Lindo said.\n",
      "All morning, police investigators and crime scene technicians, some of them dressed in protective clothing and carrying plastic sheeting, went in and out of the heavily gated apartment complex, a ring of nine-story buildings around a courtyard. Residents poured out into the cold in a steady rush-hour stream, on their way to work or to take children to school and day care.\n",
      "The shootings sent waves of grief through the area.\n",
      "“In the nature of this business, we deal with death and tragic scenes,” said Assistant Chief Jeffrey Maddrey, the commanding officer of Brooklyn North, “but when it involves an infant it’s extremely tough.”\n",

      "Adults are supposed to take care of children — not only keep them safe, but make them feel safe. Schools are essentially an extension of the home, in that sense, providing sanctuaries of learning, of nurturing and care. But after years of attacks by people with weapons of war, students cannot feel safe and are demanding that adults end years of complaisance and act. They are not asking for their schools to become armed garrisons. Rather, they want those weapons to be brought under control. And unlike too many adults, the young people leading Wednesday’s walkout at schools around the country — inspired by angry, motivated students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed by a former student with an assault weapon — have had the courage to take on the industry responsible for blocking every reasonable measure to limit access to guns, including those that make it all too easy to commit mass murder.\n",
      "As Stoneman Douglas junior Florence Yared said in front of the Florida State Capitol late last month, “You adults have failed us by not creating a safer place for your children to go to school. So we, the next generation, will not fail our own kids. We will make this change happen. If not today, then tomorrow, and if not tomorrow, next year. Take it from us. You created a mess for us, but we will make this world safer for our children.”\n",
      "With Wednesday’s demonstration, and their March for Our Lives movement on March 24 in Washington, young voices are being heard. How will the nation’s adults respond? Hopefully, by amplifying their demand: Never again.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Since last week’s deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., a pitched national conversation about gun policy has dominated town hall meetings, a White House summit meeting, the annual Conservative Political Action Conference and the never-ending stream of social media feeds.\n",
      "Below is a brief review of several laws governing guns in the United States and how effective those policies have been in curbing violence.\n",
      "Some of the toughest laws that regulate the production, distribution and use of firearms in the United States were passed after major acts of violence.\n",
      "■ The National Firearms Act of 1934 was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt after high-profile gangland crimes, including the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in 1929 that killed seven in Chicago. The law imposed a $200 tax on transfers of machine guns, short-barrel rifles and shotguns, and it required gun owners to register those weapons.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "At the time, the tax was “considered quite severe and adequate” to discourage or eliminate sales of those guns, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It still stands at $200 — even though its current value, after adjusting for inflation, would come to about $3,700.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "■ The Gun Control Act of 1968 was passed after the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. It banned interstate mail orders of all firearms, interstate handgun sales and weapons with no “sporting purpose.” It prohibited the sale of firearms to minors, felons, fugitives, drug addicts and those committed to a mental institution. And it required gun manufacturers and dealers to be licensed and maintain records of sales.\n",
      "■ After an intense lobbying effort by gun advocates, the Firearms Owners’ Protection Act of 1986 lifted some of those restrictions. The 1986 law allowed dealers to sell rifles and shotguns through the mail, and it limited federal inspections of gun dealers. It also prohibited the sale of machine guns manufactured after May 19, 1986.\n",

And you agree to our Terms of Service.\n",
      "Thank you for your submission.\n",
      "■ The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 further amended the 1968 law: It required gun purchasers not already licensed to possess a firearm to undergo background checks when buying from sellers licensed by the federal government. However, private transactions were exempted, creating the so-called gun-show loophole.\n",
      "■ The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned the possession, transfer or domestic manufacturing of some semiautomatic assault weapons for 10 years. Known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, it expired in 2004, despite efforts by gun control advocates to extend it.\n",
      "■ In 2008, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act after a shooting at  Virginia Tech a year earlier had killed 33. The law created a series of incentives and systems — but not requirements — for states to share information with the federal government about people who have been disqualified from obtaining guns.\n",
      "Eight states have enacted some kind of ban on assault weapons. Two other states regulate military-grade firearms. State gun laws are tracked, in detail, by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which lobbies for gun control.\n",
      "According to the law center, states with the strictest gun control measures have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths. Those states include California, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. Conversely, states that do not aggressively regulate guns — like Alabama, Alaska and Louisiana — have the highest.\n",

      "Still, as Lisa Foderaro and Kristin Hussey have reported for The New York Times, “Cities like Chicago and Baltimore, with rigorous gun laws, also have two of the highest murder rates in the country. The black market for illegal guns has thrived in those cities, with gang members and criminals turning to the streets to get firearms.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Some state gun control laws have come under court review. In one prominent case, the Supreme Court limited gun control efforts in its 2009 ruling District of Columbia v. Heller.\n",
      "Since then, however, the United States’ highest court has opted to not consider other Second Amendment cases, including in 2016, when it declined to hear challenges to bans on assault weapons in Connecticut and New York. Those state laws were passed after 20 first graders and six adults were killed in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n",
      "In choosing to not hear those cases, “the justices have given at least tacit approval to broad gun control laws in states and localities that choose to enact them,” wrote Adam Liptak, the legal affairs correspondent for The Times.\n",
      "It’s difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to experts and research.\n",
      "The National Rifle Association has “successfully built in ineffectiveness” to gun control legislation, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.”\n",
      "“Part of the story is that the N.R.A. fights tooth and nail against any policy,” Mr. Winkler said. “The laws that result are much less ambitious in their goals.”\n",
      "The gun control laws had some effect. The 1934 restrictions curbed access to machine guns; crimes with those types of fully automatic firearms have essentially dried up since the era of Al Capone. The 1968 prohibitions on who can own a weapon, and requirements for licensing dealers, are still in place.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the  Justice Department to argue that the “ban could not be credited with any reduction in crime.”\n",
      "On the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that “the number of gun massacres fell by 37%” while the ban was in place.\n",
      "Christopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident.\n",
      "“My work is often cited in misleading ways that don’t give the full picture,” Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. “These laws can modestly reduce shootings overall” and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings.\n",
      "Ms. Feinstein’s claim that the ban drastically reduced gun massacres comes from analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston. But Mr. Winkler noted that most mass shootings are committed with a handgun, not a military-grade assault weapon.\n",
      "“There’s no anti-mass shooting law to test,” said Charles Branas, the chairman of the epidemiology department at the School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York. “In terms of all of these instances, not just mass shootings, we need the politicians to create more laws to test.”\n",

      "At an intense town hall-style meeting Wednesday night, Diane Wolk Rogers, a history teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., confronted a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association over the Second Amendment. How did allowing the 19-year-old shooter in last week’s massacre to own an assault rifle represent “a well-regulated militia” as is written in the amendment, she asked.\n",

      "Mr. Beigel, 35, was fatally shot before he could lock the classroom door.\n",

      "In a movement that has been building since the massacre last week, student organizers said on Sunday that they would mount a demonstration next month in Washington called March For Our Lives. Their mission is to pivot America’s long-running gun control debate — which tends to flare up with each mass shooting and then dissipate — toward meaningful action.\n",
      "“We want this to stop. We need this to stop. We are protecting guns more than people,” said Emma González, 18, one of five core organizers, whose impassioned speech at a rally in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday drew national attention. “We are not trying to take people’s guns away; we are trying to make sure we have gun safety.”\n",
      "Ms. González, a senior at the school, said the group was inviting elected officials “from any side of the political spectrum” to join the movement. But she said: “We don’t want anybody who is funded by the N.R.A. We want people who are going to be on the right side of history.”\n",
      "The organizers hope the march, scheduled for March 24, will attract students from across the country, and they say more protests are planned.\n",

      "PARKLAND, Fla. — Delaney Tarr, a high school senior, cannot remember a time when she did not know about school shootings.\n",
      "So when a fire alarm went off inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and teachers began screaming “Code red!” as confused students ran in and out of classrooms, Ms. Tarr, 17, knew what to do. Run to the safest place in the classroom — in this case, a closet packed with 19 students and their teacher.\n",
      "“I’ve been told these protocols for years,” she said. “My sister is in middle school — she’s 12 — and in elementary school, she had to do code red drills.”\n",
      "This is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 people this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices — in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman — are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "While many politicians after the shooting were focused on mental health and safety, some vocal students at Stoneman Douglas High showed no reluctance in drawing attention to gun control.\n",
      "They called out politicians over Twitter, with one student telling Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, “YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND.” Shortly after the shooting, Cameron Kasky, a junior at the school, and a few friends started a “Never Again” campaign on Facebook that shared stories and perspectives from other students who survived the rampage.\n",
      "On a day when the funerals of the shooting victims began here, more than a dozen schools from Massachusetts to Iowa to Michigan were shut down in response to copycat threats and social media interpreted in the worst light. A college near Seattle was on lockdown for several hours on Friday after an unfounded report of gunfire and in at least one case an entire district closed down. Several students have been arrested, accused of phoning in threats to their schools.\n",
      "Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control.\n",
      "At other high schools across the country, students rallied in solidarity with Stoneman Douglas High and staged walkouts to protest what they called Washington’s inaction in protecting students and teachers. A gun control advocacy group, Moms Demand Action, said it had been so overwhelmed with requests from students that it was setting up a parallel, student focused advocacy group.\n",
      "“People say it’s too early to talk about it,” Mr. Kasky said. “If you ask me, it’s way too late.”\n",
      "His argument reflects the words of other students who want action: The issue is not an abstraction to them. These are their murdered friends, their bloodstained schools, their upended lives.\n",
      "Students said they did not want to cede the discussion over their lives to politicians and adult activists.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“We need to take it into our hands,” Mr. Kasky said.\n",
      "David Hogg, a 17-year-old student journalist who interviewed his classmates during the rampage in Parkland, said he had thought about the possibility of a school shooting long before shots from an AR-15 started to blast through the hallways. As he huddled with fellow students, he stayed calm and decided to try to create a record of their thoughts and views that would live on, even if the worst happened to them.\n",

      "“I recorded those videos because I didn’t know if I was going to survive,” he said in an interview here. “But I knew that if those videos survived, they would echo on and tell the story. And that story would be one that would change things, I hoped. And that would be my legacy.”\n",
      "It is a stark change from the moments that followed the Columbine shooting in April 1999, said Austin Eubanks, who survived the shooting. Mr. Eubanks and a friend hid under a table when the two teenage gunmen walked into the library and started shooting. Mr. Eubanks was wounded. His friend, Corey DePooter, was killed.\n",
      "“There was nobody who took an activism stance,” Mr. Eubanks said of Columbine’s immediate aftermath. He said he began abusing opiates shortly after as a coping mechanism. “I just wanted to be left alone. I was so destabilized and traumatized.”\n",
      "Mr. Eubanks now helps run an addiction treatment center in Colorado and has sons of his own, aged 8 and 12. The oldest has asked why Columbine happened and whether he needs to be afraid, and Mr. Eubanks said he has tried to make the boys feel safe while also discussing how children can drift toward violence.\n",
      "No matter how rare school shootings are for the vast majority of students, they have grown up in a world so attuned to these threats that high schoolers are now more conversant in the language of lockdowns and code red drills than their parents.\n",
      "Spencer Collier, the police chief in Selma, Ala., was chatting recently with a group of high school students when they brought up mass shootings and pressed him about current trends and what law enforcement agencies were doing to address them. In Connecticut, Nathaniel Laske, a high school junior, said he had asked school administrators about the apparent absence of lockdown drills or a mass shooting plan in the event something happened during school theater productions.\n",
      "“A lot of people aren’t willing to talk about it,” Mr. Laske said. “When you’re part of a school community it makes you much more inclined to want to prevent things.”\n",
      "Soon after Amy Campbell-Oates, 16, heard about the Parkland shooting, she knew she wanted to try, in some small way, to influence the national discussion on gun violence. She and two friends organized a protest, made posters, and on Friday, they rallied with dozens of fellow students from South Broward High School.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "They carried signs that read “It Could’ve Been Us,” and “Your Silence is Killing Us,” and “We Stand with Stoneman Douglas.” They chanted, their collective voices rising as cars honked in support.\n",
      "“We agreed that our politicians have to do more than say thoughts and prayers,” Ms. Campbell-Oates said. “We want voters to know that midterms are coming up. Some of us can’t vote yet but we want to get to the people that can to vote in common sense laws, ban assault rifles and require mental health checks before gun purchases.”\n",
      "Tyra Hemans, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High, made a poster, too, emblazoned with the word “ENOUGH.” On Friday, Ms. Hemans attended the funeral for Meadow Pollack, one of the 17 people killed, and then she spoke about her desire to see President Trump when he visits the area.\n",
      "“I want our politicians to stop thinking about money and start thinking about all these lives we have lost,” she said. “I want to talk with him about changing these laws. Seventeen people are dead, killed in minutes.”\n",

      "When a gunman rampaged through a high school in Parkland, Fla., three weeks ago, a 15-year-old soccer player named Anthony Borges showed undaunted courage.\n",
      "Anthony, who is of Venezuelan descent, apparently was the last of a group of students rushing into a classroom to seek refuge. He shut the door behind him and frantically tried to lock it, but in an instant the gunman appeared on the other side. Instead of running for cover, Anthony blocked the door to keep the shooter out. He held his ground even as the attacker opened fire.\n",
      "“I asked him why he would do that,” his lawyer, Alex Arreaza, told me. “He said, ‘What’s so hard to understand about what I did?’ He had no issue with risking his life.”\n",
      "Shot five times in the legs and torso, Anthony phoned his father to say that he had been wounded. He was rushed to a hospital and survived: Photos show him with wires and tubes snaking from him. He still can’t walk — it’s unclear if that is just temporary — but fellow students say he saved their lives. No one else in that classroom was shot.\n",
      "The world turned upside down: Armed law enforcement officers dawdled outside during the shooting, but a 15-year-old kid without any weapon at all used himself as a human shield to protect his classmates. More broadly, the Florida high school students have argued maturely for sensible gun laws, while Florida state legislators have acted like frightened toddlers, first passing a two-year moratorium on sales of AR-15 rifles and then undoing it 15 minutes later.\n",
      "And now it seems that the grown-up world is again going to fail Anthony and other young Americans. Congress and President Trump have stalled on a push to pass meaningful gun legislation that has overwhelming public support. The grown-ups are once more loitering in a crisis, leaving kids to be shot.\n",
      "President Trump said that if he had been on the scene, he would have rushed into the building to confront the shooter. “I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon,” he said.\n",
      "Really? Even though when he is armed with the power of the White House he still doesn’t have the guts to confront the N.R.A. in a sustained way?\n",
      "Given that gun owners largely trust Trump, he could hammer out a bipartisan deal for universal background checks — the single step that would make the most difference, one supported overwhelmingly even by gun owners — but the White House is AWOL on the issue.\n",
      "Congress may pass “Fix NICS” legislation to improve the F.B.I. database used to screen gun buyers, and maybe the federal government will ban “bump stocks.” But those are baby steps that probably won’t have a measurable impact on American mortality (right now, one American dies every 15 minutes from a gun, including murders, accidents and suicides).\n",
      "Incredibly, Congress seems as likely to ease gun laws as to tighten them. One measure backed by Donald Trump Jr. would legalize silencers, which have been rigorously controlled since the 1930s. Advocates had the gall to call it the Hearing Protection Act.\n",
      "“It’s about safety,” Trump Jr. explains in a video. “It’s about hearing protection. It’s a health issue, frankly, for me. Getting little kids in the game.” In fact, the unmuffled crack of a gunshot is a warning of danger and draws the police; silencers would be a gift to criminals.\n",
      "Even worse, the N.R.A. is pushing concealed-carry reciprocity, allowing people to carry concealed guns with them from places that permit them, like Alaska or Wyoming, to any other part of the country, regardless of local prohibitions.\n",
      "This measure has already passed the House of Representatives, but attorneys general are fighting it. They warn that it would let a stalker, domestic abuser or suspected terrorist from a low-regulation state tote concealed weapons at will around the country.\n",
      "All this is infuriating. But even if the federal government won’t pass meaningful new gun laws, states are doing so. Polls show that voters overwhelmingly favor universal background checks, a 21-year-old age restriction on buying firearms and a ban on high-capacity magazines.\n",
      "Since the 1970s, the U.S. has engaged unintentionally in an international experiment, relaxing gun laws as the rest of the world has tightened access. Gun advocates argued that more guns would make us safer, but instead the U.S. now has 25 times the gun murder rate of other advanced countries.\n",
      "Indeed, since 1970, more Americans have died of gun violence, including murders, suicides and accidents (1.4 million), than in all the wars in American history (1.3 million).\n",
      "Whenever there is a mass shooting, there are inspiring individual stories like Anthony’s. But the larger picture is disgraceful: the president and congressional leaders dillydallying on the sidelines, sending “thoughts and prayers” and nothing else.\n",
      "This will change only when politicians are more afraid of voters than of the N.R.A. ☐\n",

      "Dr. Peek studies how to keep children safe from natural disasters.\n",
      "Last week, thousands of teachers in Oklahoma and Kentucky walked out of their classrooms. West Virginia teachers did the same thing in February, and Arizona may be next. They are protesting state governments that are failing to pay teachers a decent wage, replace outdated textbooks, ensure manageable class sizes and fix school buildings in need of repair.\n",
      "But our schools have even bigger problems.\n",
      "Every weekday during the academic year, more than 50 million children across the United States enter public school buildings. Many of these buildings are so dilapidated and poorly designed that children’s health and safety are at risk.\n",
      "Some are in floodplains or lack heat or air conditioning. Others lie near fault lines and haven’t been built to withstand earthquakes.\n",
      "Young Americans are coming of age in a world that is drier and hotter than ever before. Wildfires, severe storms, floods and other environmental extremes will become more frequent and intense. Natural hazards, when combined with crumbling infrastructure, can lead to disaster.\n",
      "Consider tornadoes. About 1,200 occur annually in the United States. Oklahoma also happens to be one of the most tornado-prone states in the nation. In May 2013, 56 schools there were damaged or destroyed by tornadoes, including Plaza Towers Elementary School, where seven children were killed. That school did not have a tornado shelter or safe room. State Representative Rebecca Hamilton said that every child who died there “was our responsibility.” She added: “A tornado didn’t kill them. We did.”\n",
      "Fewer than half of public schools in Oklahoma have a tornado shelter, and in 2017 the Oklahoma Uniform Building Code Commission quietly removed the requirement that new schools have them.\n",
      "Oklahoma teachers are lobbying lawmakers for $200 million in increased school funding over the next three years. But it would cost more than $1 billion just to protect the state’s schoolchildren from tornadoes.\n",
      "Flooding is the most common and costly natural hazard in the United States. According to a  report from the Pew Charitable Trusts, 6,444 schools — which serve nearly four million students — are in places highly vulnerable to flooding. Before West Virginia teachers walked out of their classrooms to demand higher pay, many were flooded out following historic rainfall in June 2016. At least 35 schools sustained minor to severe damage.\n",
      "Heat waves claim more lives than any other natural hazard, and in 11 of the country’s largest school districts, in addition to countless smaller ones, many schools do not have air-conditioning.\n",
      "In the Santa Maria-Bonita School District in California, teachers report that classroom temperatures sometimes reach 90 degrees. Thirty percent of the classrooms in the district lack air-conditioning, primarily because they are in old buildings that do not have the electrical capacity to support portable units. It would cost upward of $45 million to install central air in all classrooms. In 2015 the teachers’ union asked the school board for that funding, but the request was denied. Some teachers have resorted to offering sweaty and distracted students small cooling towels purchased with donated funds.\n",
      "At the other end of the temperature spectrum, cold snaps have left children shivering in schools with malfunctioning boilers and drafty windows that do little to protect them when temperatures dip below zero. Low-income and black and Hispanic students are more likely to attend such poorly maintained schools.\n",
      "This winter, Marietta English, president of the Baltimore Teachers Union, wrote in a letter to the school system’s chief executive, Sonja Santelises, that “trying to provide a stable learning environment in these extreme conditions is unfair and inhumane.” Dr. Santelises acknowledged that “too many of our buildings have outdated heating systems, poor insulation and aging pipes as a result of years of inadequate funding for maintenance and facilities improvements.”\n",
      "When it comes to earthquakes, we have seen some progress in terms of seismic upgrades for schools in states such as California and Oregon. But many other places lag woefully behind.\n",
      "In Utah, hundreds of old school buildings with unreinforced masonry lie along or near the Wasatch Fault and could suffer serious damage, including complete collapse, in an earthquake. And in Washington, one in three children attend schools built before seismic construction standards were adopted statewide. The most unsafe schools are largely in poorer districts.\n",
      "This is another reminder that these issues are not just environmental. They are social justice issues, too.\n",
      "If we legally require children to attend school, then we should be held accountable for keeping them safe there. We need to see a real investment in our nation’s school infrastructure and emergency planning efforts.\n",
      "The American Society of Civil Engineers, which assigned our deteriorating school facilities a D+, estimates that just maintaining and operating them will cost $58 billion annually, while upgrading them would cost $77 billion annually.\n",
      "We also need to spend more on predisaster mitigation efforts like reinforcing old schools and building storm shelters. The National Institute of Building Sciences recently reported that the nation could save $6 for every $1 it invests in mitigation by limiting the damage when disasters occur. And last year the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued guidelines, which I helped develop, on school building safety and emergency preparedness that all school systems should follow.\n",
      "Students recently walked out of school to draw attention to gun violence. Should they do the same to protest all the other ways their safety is being put at risk? What would happen if children walked out of schools that are in floodplains or near fault lines? Should those without access to storm shelters in Tornado Alley refuse to show up until lawmakers do something? Should students who are too hot or too cold to learn just put down their pencils?\n",
      "Of course, this is not really an option. Children’s educations are too important to interrupt, and many students who attend shoddy schools may never experience a catastrophe. But we need to spend whatever time and money it takes to ensure those buildings are safe. Well-meaning parents shouldn’t have to hope, as they send their kids off to school, that their loved ones will graduate before the next big disaster strikes.\n",
      "Lori Peek is the director of the Natural Hazards Center and a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is a co-author of “Children of Katrina” and helped write “Safer, Stronger, Smarter: A Guide to Improving School Natural Hazard Safety.”\n",

      "Hannah Reyes Morales photographed more than 20 corpses, as well as police officers and grieving families throughout Manila in 2016. \n",
      "She was not alone.\n",
      "Many local and international photographers were often nearby documenting the death toll from the brutal war on drugs started by Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine president.\n",
      "After a few nights, she grew tired of photographing the murder scenes that dominated the coverage. She admired her colleagues’ commitment to documenting the killings, but she felt she had little to add that was new. Instead, she turned her attention to the residents of the densely packed slums where most of the bodies were found.\n",
      "“Crowds of families and children would gather to see what was going on, to see the journalists, to see the body, to see the police,” she said. “And then after the body would be packed up, people would retreat back into their homes very quietly. And I knew that the next day that they would have just a normal day.”\n",
      "Most of the international coverage focused on the bodies and where they were found, Ms. Morales, 27, explained. But there are also “people and communities that continue to live amid all this violence and all this death.” \n",
      "Since they were often overlooked, she said, she decided to photograph the daily lives of residents of these impoverished neighborhoods and put “a human face on those who are most affected.” \n",
      "Ms. Morales returned to the scenes where she had photographed bodies and got to know the people who lived there. And she kept going back, visiting people at home and listening to their stories. Some of the people she photographed had lost a loved one to the drug wars, but many of them were neighbors.\n",
      "The Philippine government insists that fewer than 4,000 people have been killed since Mr. Duterte took office in 2016. But last month, Human Rights Watch estimated that more than 12,000 suspected drug users and dealers, mostly from poor families, have died in the crackdown. Many of these killings occurred in a handful of very poor neighborhoods throughout Manila.\n",
      "International news media outlets paid attention as the body count skyrocketed in 2016, but most foreign journalists drifted away even as the killings continued through 2017. Between other assignments Ms. Morales continued to photograph the people who lived amid the violence. \n",
      "Ms. Morales grew up in Manila, where she lived in a modest home with her single mother and more than a dozen relatives. It was, she said, “a simple life.” Going to school, she passed by informal settlements where people lived in ramshackle houses. She attended an all-girls Catholic school run by activist nuns, where part of the curriculum took students to visit these neighborhoods to see how others lived and to help them. \n",
      "In high school, Ms. Morales volunteered to tutor children in these communities in reading and writing. Though she was not wealthy, she was “ luckier then they were,” she said. Yet she identified with these children and working with them was a formative experience.\n",
      "“I was always very much aware and curious about their lives, and I was already interested in photography, but I didn’t have a camera yet,” she said. “I wanted to photograph them, but l just didn’t have the means.” \n",
      "Ms. Morales studied communication at the University of the Philippines, where she took a photography class. She got an internship with EPA, the European Pressphoto Agency, during which she had a photo published on Lens in Photos of the Day. She has been on assignment for National Geographic and CNN Philippines and has photographed for and contributed reporting to The New York Times. \n",
      "Though the killings have slowed, Ms. Morales continues working on her project whenever she is home. Most of the people she photographs take pride in their community, she said, though gun violence was “just like a matter of fact for them and a part of daily life.” Her subjects are “well aware of the cards they have been dealt,” she said, yet “full of grace and very resilient.”\n",
      "“We Filipinos are a hopeful people,” Ms. Morales said. “The tenderness and the love that I try to convey in the images for me is a part of the Filipino resilience — they keep their quality of life going even as all of this violence is happening around you.”\n",

      "\n",
      "In the wake of Florida’s latest shooting massacre, and calls to tighten its relaxed gun laws, Gov. Rick Scott declared that now, everything was on the table.\n",
      "Yet the governor sidestepped whether he would explicitly support new gun restrictions. And he emphasized he would never “trample” on anyone’s constitutional rights.\n",
      "In Florida — where a troubled teenager used a legally purchased military-style semiautomatic rifle to kill 17 people at a high school this past week — extraordinary political obstacles would have to be overcome before any real changes in gun laws could occur.\n",
      "A strong case can be made that the state has been the most important laboratory for pioneering far-reaching, pro-gun regulatory blueprints later adopted throughout the nation, profoundly changing how guns are regulated across the United States.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "And Florida’s gun lobby continues to instill fear in lawmakers. It is led by Marion Hammer, 78, who grew up shooting rabbits, reportedly packs a pistol in her purse and seeks political vengeance on legislators who disappoint her.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Though Florida is a purple state, Mr. Scott, a favorite of gun lobbyists, and other Republicans control state government, and they have steadfastly opposed new restrictions. For gun-control advocates, victories of late have included steps like defeating legislation to allow some people to carry guns into airport terminals.\n",
      "Gun owners are now a major constituency, too: Nearly two million residents have permits to carry concealed weapons, far more than any other state.\n",
      "Florida, however, cannot be called the place with the most permissive gun regulations. Some states, for example, do not require permits to carry concealed weapons. While Florida gets an “F” rating, the lowest, from one major gun-control group, the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, 24 other states also share that ranking.\n",
      "The state’s more significant pro-gun legacy has been spearheading two influential changes in gun regulations that became models for many other states: Laws that essentially require the authorities to issue permits for carrying concealed guns to residents who pass a simple protocol.\n",
      "And “Stand Your Ground” laws that give protections to people who use deadly force in public if they argue that they felt they were in imminent danger. Critics call them “shoot first” laws and say they encourage escalations in violence and make it harder to punish some wrongdoers.\n",
      "Most states now have Stand Your Ground laws as well as permissive rules allowing the carrying of concealed weapons.\n",
      "Florida’s pro-gun approach came under scrutiny after mass shootings in Orlando in 2016 and in Fort Lauderdale last year. But, little changed in the Statehouse; bills to limit assault weapons, for example, did not get a hearing.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Even after the massacre in Parkland last week, the only movement on gun bills dealt with proposals to expand where guns could be carried, not to restrict them.\n",
      "State Senator Dennis Baxley, a Republican who wrote the Stand Your Ground law in 2005 and is a major gun-rights backer, doubts gun-control proposals will gain traction.\n",
      "“I don’t see any interest here on that,” said Mr. Baxley, who represents parts of Sumter, Marion and Lake Counties. “We’re pretty comfortable that freedom works.”\n",
      "Mr. Baxley likens gun restrictions to imposing limits on forks and spoons to reduce obesity. He argued the focus needs to be on school safety.\n",
      "Just after the Parkland shooting, a move to try to advance another of Mr. Baxley’s bills — allowing officials to permit certain adults to carry guns at schools if they pass a screening — prompted anger from critics. Mr. Baxley said the bill would deter shootings, but critics called it the latest effort to chip away at prohibitions on guns in schools.\n",
      "In any case, Mr. Baxley said lawmakers later decided to take the proposal off this week’s agenda. “I don’t think we’re ready for that discussion yet,” he said.\n",
      "More to the point for gun-control advocates is whether fury over the Parkland massacre might make a difference among Republican legislators who did not tighten gun laws after the killing of 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando two years ago.\n",
      "“They didn’t do anything after Pulse, but these are 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds getting slaughtered,” said State Senator Linda Stewart, a Democrat who represents part of Orange County. Ms. Stewart said her legislation banning assault weapons after the Orlando massacre had not even been assigned to a committee.\n",

      "At the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday, hundreds of people gathered for a rally promoting gun reform in what one official called the “gunshine state.” The day’s speakers shouted into a microphone until their voices were hoarse and children barely out of diapers gripped giant signs. “Enough is enough,” read one.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Changing Florida’s gun laws could come down to two things: Whether Ms. Hammer can keep legislators from breaking ranks. And, the ambitions of Mr. Scott, who is increasingly expected to challenge Bill Nelson, the state’s incumbent Democratic senator this year.\n",
      "Ms. Hammer, who stands barely 5 feet tall, has been the state’s chief gun lobbyist for decades and was the first woman to serve as national N.R.A. president. The state’s Stand Your Ground and concealed-carry laws were largely her initiatives.\n",
      "Legislators, especially Republicans, fear her ability to marshal angry emails from thousands of gun owners in every pocket of the state, destroying ambitions of even onetime allies.\n",
      "“She can be pretty hard on people who aren’t coming around,” Mr. Baxley said. “She has a long memory when you cross her.”\n",
      "Many point to Charles McBurney, a former Republican state representative and N.R.A. ally, who two years ago sided with prosecutors and blocked one of Ms. Hammer’s favored bills. Facing term limits, Mr. McBurney was considered a very strong choice for a gubernatorial appointment to a judgeship in Jacksonville, his hometown.\n",
      "But Mr. Scott passed him over after Ms. Hammer began a ferocious email campaign demanding he not be selected. A spokeswoman for Mr. Scott denied that the gun lobby influenced the decision.\n",
      "Mr. Baxley isn’t so sure. He said the governor had to be thinking, “Why would I cross all these N.R.A. members?”\n",
      "Mr. McBurney declined to comment. Ms. Hammer did not respond to a request for comment sent through the N.R.A.’s national office.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Another wild card, conceivably, is Mr. Scott, who Ms. Hammer once praised for having signed more pro-gun bills in one term than any Florida governor in history.\n",
      "After the Orlando massacre — where the killer also used a military-style semiautomatic rifle — the governor said that “the Second Amendment didn’t kill anybody.”\n",
      "But after CNN’s Wolf Blitzer repeatedly pressed him last week about what he would do to prevent another massacre, Mr. Scott said, “Everything’s on the table, all right? I’m going to look at every way that we can make sure our kids are safe.”\n",
      "Some suggested this revealed a new openness for regulation, now that he may face a hard-fought campaign against Mr. Nelson.\n",
      "Asked for clarification on whether the governor might back new gun restrictions, his spokeswoman said she hoped to have more information this week, after he meets with other leaders to discuss “ways to keep Florida students safe, including school safety improvements and keeping guns away from individuals struggling with mental illness.”\n",
      "Some critics call the focus on mental health a subterfuge. Federal law already bars people who have been adjudicated mentally ill or committed to institutions from buying firearms. Despite their rhetoric, state Republican leaders have not proposed expanding mental-health restrictions inside Florida, critics say.\n",
      "It also deflects attention from other issues, like making sure powerful assault weapons and hundreds of rounds of high-velocity ammunition cannot be bought in short order by teenagers, said Patricia Brigham, a chair of the Florida Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence. “It’s the typical bait-and-switch argument,” she said.\n",

      "The saddest fact in all of this is that nothing will change. After all of the investigations into motives, investigations of the personality of the killer, looking at his postings on social media, talking to his friends and relatives, the one thing that will be ignored is that weapons designed exclusively for warfare, weapons whose specific purpose is to inflict as much damage to humans in as short a time as possible, are so readily available to the public.\n",
      "As long as our elected representatives blindly do the bidding of the National Rifle Association, such shootings will continue. It should be apparent that the real government of the United States isn’t Congress, the presidency or the judiciary.

      "The laid-back companies of Silicon Valley are known for corporate headquarters that resemble universities, where employees mingle with tourists taking selfies and collaborations take shape out on the quad.\n",

      "But those generous green spaces and relaxed atmospheres come with a trade-off: They’re difficult to secure.\n",
      "Many Google employees love the headquarters’ open nature but some worry about it, according to one current and one former Google employee who declined to be named because of a company policy barring workers from speaking to the news media. There is often no barrier between employees and the public, they said. People — most likely other employees — sometimes slip into buildings behind workers with badges, they said, and neither had ever seen an armed guard on campus. Google declined to comment.\n",

      "The shooting this week at the headquarters of YouTube, a Google-owned company about 25 miles north in San Bruno, has highlighted the security risks of Silicon Valley’s relatively open corporate campuses — particularly as tech companies’ expanding influence angers more people online.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But the risk is not confined to the tech sector. Many companies across the country are similarly exposed, reflecting an open-door policy that for generations has pervaded corporate America, where safety training has long focused on fire drills, earthquake-sheltering procedures and accident cleanup.\n",
      "Some of that trust has eroded over the years. After the World Trade Center attacks in 2001, companies fearing terrorist bombings and biochemical attacks taught employees how to handle suspicious packages. But a sharp increase in mass shootings over the past two decades has made companies increasingly nervous about gun violence from disgruntled workers and customers.\n",
      "Last year, an employee fatally shot three people at the United Parcel Service complex in San Francisco. In 2016, an employee fatally shot three colleagues and injured 14 more at a lawn care equipment factory in Kansas. In 2012, a man shot seven people and himself at a Minneapolis sign company hours after he was fired.\n",

The gate between the parking garage and the courtyard was unlocked, according to Zach Vorhies, an engineer at YouTube. A former YouTube employee who used to handle threats from disgruntled video creators, but was not allowed to speak about it publicly, said his team repeatedly warned YouTube security about the risk of the parking garage and unlocked gate, but it was never fixed.\n",

      "The class was supposed to be temporary, a quick dive into the link between literature and anthropology. The professors had no idea if students would even come. It wasn’t mandatory, they wouldn’t get credit and it was taking place at night. Friday night.\n",
      "So no one was more surprised than Kara Wittman and Joanne Nucho when 24 people showed up for their “Essay as Resistance” class, which had its debut at Pomona College in March 2017 and ran for three 90-minute sessions. “We were shocked that it was so popular,” said Ms. Wittman, an assistant professor of English at Pomona, in Claremont, Calif., who taught the class with Ms. Nucho, an assistant professor of anthropology there.\n",
      "But that’s exactly the appeal of the so-called pop-up class, an experiential, interdisciplinary, extracurricular workshop that appears briefly and usually vanishes.\n",
      "Pop-up classes have grown in popularity over the last few years, with a number of colleges and universities offering them. They’re often related to current events. Bennington College’s “Am I Charlie?,” held in 2015, was a response to the attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in France. “White Privilege” was offered last year at St. Michael’s College in Colchester, Vt., when Black Lives Matter gained traction on campus.\n",
      "“It was a time when our community on campus and nationally was divided around issues of race, and we wanted to give our students the opportunity to discuss some of these challenging topics,” said Kimoi Seale, assistant dean of students, who taught the “White Privilege” class.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Pop-ups have appeared in various incarnations for a while, but are often traced to Stanford University’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, commonly called the D.school, for seasoned instructors to try out new course content.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "More recently, the D.school’s University Innovation Fellows program began to use pop-ups as tools for students to be more engaged in their own learning environments. The D.school’s pop-ups have since become “Pop Outs,” which have a narrower focus.\n",
      "Timothy Moore, 25, was a University Innovation fellow in 2015. After being introduced to the idea of pop-ups, he brought the concept back to James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., from which he graduated that year. The university’s X-Lab has since held pop-ups in everything from building ukuleles to ice-cream making using liquid nitrogen.\n",
      "Welcome to the new Learning section — a deep dive into the joys, excitement, challenges and opportunities in the world of education and learning. This is the first of four refreshed and redesigned sections we will publish this year.\n",
      "Drawing on the commitment to the subject and the expertise across The New York Times, we want Learning to be a place where educators, students and parents can join a vigorous conversation around the best ways to educate people, whether children or adults. (You can reach us at  learningsection@nytimes.com with comments and ideas.) - Jane Bornemeier, Editor\n",
      "“A lot of teachers don’t realize that the pop-up will make their curriculum stronger,” said Mr. Moore, who now works at Claremont College’s Hive, a program at the school that brings students together across disciplines to practice human-centered approached to real-world problems. “They’re a low-risk way to try out a class.”\n",
      "The beauty of the pop-up is that anything goes. Some classes last a few weeks; others run for a day or weekend. Some are faculty led; others are taught by students, administrators or even local businesspeople. Some are for credit; others are strictly for fun — or, at least, personal enlightenment. And sometimes the classes are so popular that they return as full-fledged, for-credit courses, which is what happened with the “Essay as Resistance” class.\n",
      "“Our goal here is to enhance the creative capacity of our students and teach them to navigate ambiguity, and to foster experimental learning,” said Fred Leichter, founding director of the Hive, officially the Rick and Susan Sontag Center for Collaborative Creativity. “The pop-ups are designed as a way to offer things that are often mash-ups between different disciplines. To me it’s one of the purest forms of learning. Both parties are there to create something together.”\n",
      "Here is a look at some pop-ups at schools around country.\n",
      "When fires ravaged Southern California last summer and major flooding followed soon after, Char Miller took notice. Mr. Miller, director of environmental analysis at Pomona College, has been teaching about fire for over two decades. “But the particular dynamic between fires and flood, which was so horrifying this winter — we have this incredible opportunity to show students on the ground what that actually means,” he said. “It’s a way for students to understand that they live in a particular place and that the natural systems here function differently than from wherever they come.” To be taught this fall by Mr. Miller and Jeff Groves, an English professor at Harvey Mudd College.\n",
      "Last year, Margaret Hagan, director of the Legal Design Lab at Stanford and a lecturer at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, taught “Design for Justice: Traffic,” which focused on navigating the traffic court system.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The next subject, in a class running this month and next: eviction. “Most of the people who get evicted don’t take any steps to fight their notices in court. That means there’s more eviction notices because it’s easier for landlords to use the court system without opposition,” she said. “If we can inform people of their rights in responding to an eviction notice, we might get more protection to them. To use the process. So the class is a lab — where my students, legal aid and the court — help them think through what interventions they can send out to encourage people to take action.”\n",
      "Antonia Messuri, the assistant dean for academics at St. Michael’s in Colchester, Vt., regularly counsels students who are stuck in their lives. “Often our students are coming from a place of being told what to do, how to do it and when it’s due their whole lives,” she said. This class, which runs through April, “is an opportunity for them to say, ‘This is my life, my education.’ ” Students will read articles on self-determination and Buddhist writings, with a focus on meditation, resilience and grit.\n",
      "The bulk of the pop-ups at James Madison are designed to be a mix of science and technology. In this class, on April 20, students learn the basic rules for safe flying, practice flight controls and then test their skills by flying through something they can relate to: a Quidditch course. “It’s designed to expose them to lightweight drones and the opportunity to take the full drone class where they learn how to use drones to solve real-world problems,” said Nick Swayne, founding director of the university’s X-Lab. “We will also have small model rockets available for students to try. These rockets are used extensively by our geology department to increase student interest in atmospheric studies.”\n",
      "Since the spring of 2015, Bennington College in Bennington, Vt., has been offering pop-up courses. In this course, taught by State Senator Brian Campion, who is also the director of public policy programs in the Center for the Advancement of Public Action, students will explore gun culture, gun policy, the continuing work of policymakers at the state’s Capitol, and whether or not such actions are likely to be the most effective to keep citizens safe. The course, which runs through April, will bring in guests with different perspectives.\n",

      "Every few weeks or months, after a man armed with a high-powered weapon walks into a school or a church or a nightclub and opens fire, the national response plays out in a rote, almost performative way. The outcry lasts only a few days before guns fade back into the background noise of American politics.\n",
      "But nearly three weeks after a gunman walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and killed 17 people with an AR-15, the conversation has not faded, because the students of Stoneman Douglas have taken up the cause of gun control. Already, they have lobbied state lawmakers in Tallahassee, spoken with President Trump and persuaded many companies to cut ties with the National Rifle Association. And on Saturday, they met with students fighting gun violence in Chicago.\n",
      "The protests calling for stricter gun control measures come on the heels of other youth movements, but the momentum they have gained makes them stand out.\n",
      "Several of those students, and their critics, have noted the incongruity of teenagers getting involved in politics. But history is full of movements led by students — albeit usually in college, not high school. Some were successful and others brutally crushed, but even the latter still resonate. (Most of these campaigns have been liberal-leaning: Though conservative college students have made their presence known, their actions have rarely coalesced into broader movements.)\n",
      "Here are seven other cases where young people were moved to challenge adult society.\n",
      "The lunch counter sit-ins that would change American history began with four teenagers who walked up to a Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C., and refused to leave.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Those young men — Ezell Blair Jr., 18; Franklin McCain, 19; Joseph McNeil, 17; and David Richmond, 18, all students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University — made their stand on Feb. 1, 1960. Within three days, they were joined by some 300 others. By summer, the sit-ins had spread to more than 50 cities, and lunch counters were rapidly desegregating.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The actions of the so-called Greensboro Four led directly to the creation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which the civil rights organizer Ella Baker urged students to form in April 1960 to coordinate the continuing sit-ins. Later, SNCC would play a major role in the Freedom Rides and in voter registration efforts across the South. And the momentum that began at the Woolworth’s lunch counter would eventually contribute to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed segregation in public spaces.\n",
      "Perhaps more than anything, the results of the Greensboro sit-ins showed the power of a small group of students prepared to stand alone if necessary.\n",
      "“Inevitably, people ask me, ‘What can I do?’” Mr. McCain said in an interview in 2005. “What kind of question is that? Look around you. Once you identify what you want to do, don’t ask for the masses to help you, because they won’t come.”\n",
      "In the spring of 1968, student protests exploded on multiple continents. Some accomplished their stated goals and others did not, but even the latter contributed to a climate in which change seemed possible and more people were inspired to act.\n",
      "In March, more than 1,000 students at the historically black Howard University took over the administrative building, and many more barricaded themselves in their dormitories. They demanded that the university president resign; that the curriculum emphasize African-American history and culture; that a judiciary system involving students be created; and that disciplinary proceedings against students involved in an earlier protest be dropped. The university agreed to the third and fourth demands.\n",
      "Students at Columbia University used similar tactics a month later, occupying several buildings for a week before 1,000 police officers stormed the campus to evict them. Strikes continued for the rest of the semester, essentially paralyzing the university even after the occupiers were cleared out. The students were protesting two things — the construction of a university gym in Morningside Park in Harlem that would provide only limited access to Harlem residents, and Columbia’s Vietnam-era contract with a weapons research think tank — and Columbia canceled both.\n",
      "On the other side of the Atlantic, students revolted in France and Poland. In Warsaw, protests against government censorship built from 300 students in January to 20,000 in March, but were ultimately suppressed. And in Paris, some 20,000 swarmed the Sorbonne in May, turning cars into barricades and clashing with riot police. French labor unions and teachers joined a 24-hour general strike in support of the students, bringing the nation to a grinding halt but failing to topple President Charles de Gaulle.\n",
      "As with the Greensboro sit-ins 16 years earlier, the uprising started by public school students in Soweto, South Africa, would expand far beyond them.\n",

      "On June 16, 1976, several thousand students near Johannesburg began a peaceful march that turned deadly when the police attacked with guns and tear gas. The protesters were objecting to a law that mandated Afrikaans-language education, but they set in motion a global movement against apartheid. Images of police brutality — particularly a photograph of a high school student carrying the body of Hector Pieterson (12 or 13 years old; accounts differ) — drew international attention to the broader cruelty of South Africa’s government.\n",
      "From the actions of the students of Soweto grew a vast campaign led by college students in the United States, who built shantytowns on campus quads, blockaded buildings and disrupted speeches by South African politicians. From Columbia University to the University of California, protests compelled administrators to withdraw billions of dollars in investments from companies tied to South Africa. Over time, the resulting economic stress contributed, along with other factors, to the dismantling of apartheid.\n",
      "On June 4, 1989, several weeks of student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing ended in slaughter when thousands of Chinese troops began firing on crowds of protesters in Tiananmen Square. Hundreds of people, possibly thousands, were killed; a death toll was never released.\n",
      "Nearly 30 years later, China is still not a democracy. Its trend, on display in 1989, of allowing economic but not political liberalization continues. And in some ways, the protests had the opposite of their intended effect: The crackdown provided a visceral demonstration of how far the government would go to suppress dissent, which discourages some would-be activists to this day. But an iconic image from June 5, of a lone, still unidentified man standing in front of a column of tanks, endures as an emblem of defiance in the face of overwhelming odds.\n",
      "Eight days after the Berlin Wall fell, signaling the beginning of the end of East Germany’s Communist government, the students of neighboring Czechoslovakia stepped in to topple their own.\n",
      "The uprising began with thousands and grew until Prague was flooded with 500,000 protesters, who stayed stubbornly peaceful even as riot officers attacked, giving the revolution its name. Just 11 days after the protests began, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia relinquished power, paving the way for the playwright Vaclav Havel to become president in December.\n",

      "It was an extraordinary revolution — “swift, entirely nonviolent, joyful and funny,” said the author Timothy Garten Ash — and one of the most rapid and complete successes for a student-led movement in modern history.\n",
      "After a series of scuffles between college students and the police in July 1999, officers raided a dormitory at the University of Tehran, wounding at least 20 people and jailing 125. If their goal was to stop the unrest, the police could not have gone more astray: In response, more than 10,000 Iranian students took to the streets.\n",
      "In the short term, the protests forced officials, including President Mohammad Khatami and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to condemn the police raid. The ayatollah urged restraint even if students “set my picture on fire or tear it,” a remarkable directive from a government not normally tolerant of political dissent.\n",
      "But perhaps more important were the long-term consequences. Since Iran’s 1979 revolution, student activists had generally been tied to political parties. After the 1999 protests, that ceased to be the case. And while Iran’s society and politics remain tightly regulated, the tradition of student activism has continued there, more so than in many countries with similar political systems.\n",
      "The Black Lives Matter movement began with three women in their late 20s and early 30s: Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi. But when it exploded into national view in 2014 after the police killing of Michael Brown, 18, many of the protesters who filled the streets of Ferguson, Mo., were students.\n",
      "Like the students of Parkland, they were protesting gun violence — but by the police, often involving unarmed black suspects, in shootings captured on video. Unlike the students of Parkland, they were not lauded in the prevailing public narrative, a discrepancy that some Black Lives Matter activists have noted in recent weeks. Instead, they were frequently labeled troublemakers and thugs.\n",
      "But even as questionable police shootings happen, convictions of officers remain rare, and protests on the streets continue, Black Lives Matter has had a fundamental impact on the national conversation about racial bias and the use of excessive force by the police.\n",

      "Max, Raleigh: 1) If you want to talk about aggressive masculinity having downsides, then you better mention that men continue to be the vast majority of soldiers, police officers, and firefighters — the people who die for this country, and to protect others. You can’t talk about aggressive masculinity without talking about its obvious social benefits.\n",
      "2) Yes, it’s true these killers are men. There is zero evidence that their actions were a matter of expressing masculinity. Tying them to masculinity in the absence of evidence is purely ideological.\n",
      "3) There is zero evidence that changing how we raise boys will have the intended effect. There is also zero evidence that changing how we raise boys will have a beneficial effect on boys.\n",
      "As far as I can tell, this is an excuse to continue to criticize men and masculinity without attending to the positives of men and masculinity. It will not do anything to bring our country together, or to end the tensions between the sexes.\n",
      "Michael Ian Black: 1. Aggression can certainly be a beneficial trait. The flip side of this in your examples are the often debilitating symptoms soldiers, police officers, and firefighters exhibit as a result of their jobs. So many of these men are reluctant to seek help for the simple reason that, for so many men, needing help is the same as being weak, anathema for men.\n",
      "2. I agree with you that a shooter’s motive cannot be reduced to something as simple as “being a man,” nor did I mean to imply so. My larger point is that we need to examine why only men commit these crimes. What is going on with our boys and young men that allows them to walk into a public space and open fire, but not girls and young women? My piece is an attempt to start talking about that question.\n",
      "3. My interest in writing this piece was not “bring the country together; it was an attempt to reduce gun violence and try to broaden the conversation from guns to other possible contributing factors, including the preponderance of boys committing these crimes.\n",
      "Bobotheclown: To have a loving father figure requires that he be secure, which requires that he has a job. In today’s world there are millions of people with no hope of ever being employed again. The real problem is that work itself is broken and the means by which men have always defined themselves is disappearing. A man without work is not a man at all, in the internal calculus of American masculinity. A man who no longer has a positive self-image cannot possibly raise a boy to have one. The problem is not just that our boys are broken but that our men are broken as well.\n",
      "MIB: I wholeheartedly agree about the problem of men in the culture but wanted to begin the conversation with boys and young men because I view this problem as multigenerational, and it seems to me that we need to start with the youth. We also need to decouple a man’s self-worth from his earning power, a power often out of his control. A man is more than his occupation.\n",
      "JediProf: We could start by refusing to gender certain behavior or personality traits. If someone is aggressive, just call it aggressive, not masculine. If someone is nurturing, just call it nurturing, not feminine. We need to abandon classifying the world according to masculine and feminine categories, which are inventions of society.\n",
      "MIB: Yes, the entire language around issues of masculinity (and, perhaps, femininity) needs to change. How do we do this? How does one start to build a new way to speak and think about a subject so ingrained? I don’t know.\n",
      "Mr. Florentino: I cried as I read this. My son — a high school and college wrestler who achieved much success on the mat — is one of the most sensitive souls I know. But far too often, I cheered his masculinity, his fierceness, and his muscles. I should have been cheering his kindness, his empathy, and his innate ability to be gentle. Those emotional qualities are what REALLY make him strong.\n",
      "MIB: I am very interested in a fuller expression of male strength. Physical strength is great (I wish I had more of it, because I would like, for once in my life, to look good shirtless on a beach). But a man’s strength can be expressed in innumerable ways, including the strength to be vulnerable, the strength to ask for help, to seek forgiveness, to display empathy. By all means, root for your son, but root for his entire being. It sounds like you’re doing that.\n",

      "SAN BRUNO, Calif. — A woman opened fire with a handgun at YouTube’s headquarters in California on Tuesday afternoon, shooting three people — one of whom was critically injured — before killing herself, the authorities said.\n",
      "The San Bruno Police Department identified the attacker late Tuesday as Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who was in her late 30s. The motivation for the shootings was under investigation, the police said, although her social media postings included criticisms of YouTube.\n",
      "Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital received three patients: a man, 36, in critical condition; a woman, 32, in serious condition; and a woman, 27, in fair condition, a hospital spokesman, Brent Andrew, said at a news conference. A fourth person had injuries that weren’t from a gunshot, the police said.\n",

      "Re “The Boys Are Not All Right,” by Michael Ian Black (Op-Ed, Feb. 22), which links violence by boys and men to our concepts of masculinity:\n",
      " Mr. Black asks how we can help boys. Humans are not born empathetic. Empathy is taught. Parents, caretakers, teachers and coaches must teach boys empathy by showing them affection, compassion and understanding. By responding to their needs. By giving them a safe place to express emotions and an ear to discuss them. By nurturing them.\n",
      "When someone tells my 5-year-old son, “Boys don’t cry,” he answers, “That’s not true.” Boys cry as much as girls until they’re scolded or insulted when they do. When our son cries, we let him. When he hurts himself, we comfort him. When he’s angry, we try to understand what’s bothering him. The result? His teachers tell us how kind, gentle and thoughtful he is to other children. He is still a confident, outgoing, pirate-loving boy. But we have raised him without false, demeaning, sexist views about what it means to be male or female. To us, it isn’t about gender. It’s about love.\n",

      "I play pool with a friend of mine three to four times a month. Pool is just the excuse — the vehicle to get together to understand what’s going on in each other’s lives. Implicit in those conversations is the expression of understanding of manhood. It’s all indirect, often subtle, but it’s unquestionably there.\n",
      "Women just need to listen to men converse without assumptions. We’ll rarely use such terms as mindfulness, journey, vulnerability etc. They simply do not suit our gender. But we cover these topics all the time. Women and men discuss identity differently. And that’s O.K. Really. But the last thing men want to do is talk about such stuff directly. But it’s being discussed all the time. All the time.\n",

      "By continuing to look at gender, and specifically at boys, through a heteronormative lens, we’re solidifying a binary: men as emotionally repressed, testosterone-driven predators, and women as emotionally available caregivers and targets of men’s rage. Tragically, we’re obliterating men who fall outside this narrow template of masculinity. This encourages a culture that does not recognize men as complex individualized selves. No less than women, men should not be collapsed into a rigidly stereotyped gender identity.\n",
      "In our current American culture, where women, in many areas of their lives, incorporate masculine threads and men, feminine ones, many men today actually live multigendered lives. Isn’t it time to look at men — and gender — more expansively? Only then can we begin to recognize men not only as producers and predators but as the guardians in young boys’ lives — fathers, uncles, teachers, coaches — who encourage these malleable selves to embrace their own and others’ uniqueness.\n",

      "To the Editor:\n",
      "Michael Ian Black raises a compelling question about American masculinity. In America, the popular conception of manhood has always come primarily from movies. The male protagonists of the silver screen, from John Wayne to Sean Connery to Harrison Ford to George Clooney to Denzel Washington, have defined our ideal of what a man should be. In movies, men’s cleaned-up, choreographed, heroic representations of gunfire and fistfights have presented for us romanticized, highly unrealistic notions of what violence is all about. We have accordingly developed a warped sense of how to handle aggression.\n",
      "The hero (we tend to see ourselves as the hero in the movies of our lives) says, “Bring it on,” and starts firing automatic weapons. Unlike, say, Shakespearean protagonists, he has no serious character flaws, conflicted feelings, fears, guilt or regrets. He always knows what is right and acts on it unfailingly. He has, in short, no vulnerability.\n",
      "Superheroes, from Superman to the Black Panther, are likewise fearless, intrepid and invulnerable. This ideal hardly squares with our inner life as men. Obviously movies are not to blame for the mental illness that sometimes causes gun violence. But they play an underrated part in the roles we assign to gender identity.\n",

      "This was a great article about the complexities of growing to a different manhood. The boys are not all right, but then a large portion of our business, social and personal lives are controlled by men who still promote this “suffocating, outdated model of masculinity.” We do have some different models of masculinity, such as Barack Obama, John Lewis, Justin Trudeau, Emmanuel Macron, many religious leaders and more. They are mocked and belittled by the macho culture of our society. Changing this macho culture is the solution for our boys as well as our girls.\n",

      "To the Editor:\n",
      "Michael Ian Black is correct when he asserts that “America’s boys are broken.” One way to begin to fix them is through books. In this digital age, too few American boys take the time to read great literary texts. That is sad because studies have shown that engagement with great literature builds empathy and fosters healthy self-reflection.\n",
      "We need to encourage boys to put down their phones and pick up good books that deal with the issues that growing boys face. Begin with Mark Twain’s great classic “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” the story of an abused teenage boy who runs away and bonds with a kind runaway slave.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway’s Nick Adams stories feature a boy who grows into manhood and experiences the horrors of war. To regain his emotional balance after the war, Nick reconnects with the natural world that he loved as a boy. He regains control of his life with a fishing rod, not a gun, in his hands.\n",

But I missed the many opportunities I had to exercise moral courage.\n",

      "After reading “The Boys Are Not All Right,” I was struck by the similarities between gun violence and the sexual misconduct/harassment cases that have flooded the media. As Michael Ian Black states, “manhood is measured in strength” and “manliness is about having power over others.” Some men turn to guns as an expression of rage, violence or revenge, while other men, perhaps with more fame, money and recognition, use their power to express themselves through sexual acts involving domination and control.\n",
      "Whether it be with a gun or sex organ, the harm that these groups of men and boys are inflicting on society needs to be understood.\n",
      "LINDA GILMAN, JERSEY CITY\n",
      "To the Editor:\n",
      "Michael Ian Black writes: “There has to be a way to expand what it means to be a man without losing our masculinity. I don’t know how we open ourselves to the rich complexity of our manhood.” There’s a very simple answer. Make sure boys grow up with some gay male friends in their life. That would go a long way to help them understand that empathy, vulnerability and sensitivity are not to be feared. They might also benefit from better modeling on how to treat and get along with women.\n",

Some of us are fathers, some not; some are straight, some not; some were born into male bodies, some not. All we have in common is that we’re men and we’re trying to embody a mature masculinity that welcomes the whole male experience — shame and sadness, anger and desire, tenderness and joy. I think of us as trying to, as W. H. Auden wrote, “give back to the son the mother’s richness of feeling.”\n",

      "The president mixed facts and falsehoods while discussing gun policy and potential solutions with legislators.\n",
      "By Linda Qiu\n",
      "President Trump signaled he was open to some proposals to curb gun violence on Wednesday during an hourlong televised meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers. \n",
      "But even as he voiced support for proposals generally backed by Democrats — including expanded background checks and raising the age limit to 21 for some gun buyers — the president peppered his remarks with inaccuracies about mass shootings and gun policy.\n",
      "And many of his comments hewed firmly to traditional Republican Party tenets. \n",
      "“Hey, look, I’m the biggest fan of the Second Amendment,” Mr. Trump said. But he then said law enforcement should “take the guns first, go through due process second” when dealing with people who own guns and exhibit signs of mental illness. \n",
      "The president also repeatedly chastised lawmakers for being “afraid” and “petrified” of the National Rifle Association, which he then also praised as filled with “great patriots” who are “well meaning.” \n",
      "Here are some other comments by Mr. Trump during the session, fact-checked:\n",
      "There was, in fact, an off-duty police officer working in the nightclub at the time of the shooting. Officer Adam Gruler, a member of the Orlando Police Department since 2001, responded and exchanged fire with the gunman. \n",
      "Several mass shootings have occurred in Texas.\n",
      "Some recent examples: in November, a gunman opened fire on a church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26 people. In July 2016, a sniper gunned down police officers in Dallas, leaving five dead. And in 2014, a soldier killed three others at Fort Hood in Killeen. \n",
      "Mr. Trump is referring to a 2014 study from John Lott, an economist and gun rights advocate.\n",
      "Mr. Lott found that 98.4 percent of mass public shootings have occurred in a “gun free zone.” His study looked at shootings that occurred in areas where civilians are not allowed to carry guns, as well as places that “made it extremely difficult” to obtain a concealed carry license.\n",
      "Other researchers have criticized or directly refuted Mr. Lott’s work as too broad.\n",
      "For instance, in his 2016 book, “Rampage Nation,” Louis Klarevas of the University of Massachusetts Boston criticized Mr. Lott’s definition of “gun free zones” and argued that the absence of conceal-carry laws does not equate to “gun free.” Such laws fail to account for weapons being carried by law enforcement officers, military troops or licensed professional security personnel. \n",
      "Mr. Klaveras also pointed out that Mr. Lott’s data set included military bases like Fort Hood and the Washington Navy Yard, where weapons are kept on site and held according to military protocol. \n",
      "Using his own data set of 111 mass shootings since 1966, Mr. Klarevas found that 84 percent took place in areas where civilians were allowed to carry guns. Similarly, the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety found that 70 percent of mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2015 took place in private residences.\n",
      "Fear of death or returning fire has not deterred several mass shooters in recent years. For example, perpetrators of mass shootings in Las Vegas in 2017, Isla Vista, Calif., in 2014 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 all committed suicide. \n",

      "Today’s teenagers have been raised on cellphones and social media. Should we worry about them or just get out of their way?\n",
      "A recent wave of student protests around the country has provided a close-up view of Generation Z in action, and many adults have been surprised. While there has been much hand-wringing about this cohort, also called iGen or the Post-Millennials, the stereotype of a disengaged, entitled and social-media-addicted generation doesn’t match the poised, media-savvy and inclusive young people leading the protests and gracing magazine covers.\n",
      "There’s 18-year-old Emma González, whose shaved head, impassioned speeches and torn jeans have made her the iconic face of the #NeverAgain movement, which developed after the 17 shooting deaths in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Naomi Wadler, just 11, became an overnight sensation after confidently telling a national television audience she represented “African-American girls whose stories don’t make the front page of every national newspaper.” David Hogg, a high school senior at Stoneman Douglas, has weathered numerous personal attacks with the disciplined calm of a seasoned politician.\n",
      "Sure, these kids could be outliers. But plenty of adolescent researchers believe they are not.\n",
      "“I think we must contemplate that technology is having the exact opposite effect than we perceived,” said Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and author of “How to Raise an Adult.” “We see the negatives of not going outside, can’t look people in the eye, don’t have to go through the effort of making a phone call. There are ways we see the deficiencies that social media has offered, but there are obviously tremendous upsides and positives as well.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“I am fascinated by the phenomenon we are seeing in front of us, and I don’t think it’s unique to these six or seven kids who have been the face of the Parkland adolescent cohort,” says Lisa Damour, an adolescent psychologist and author of “Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions Into Adulthood.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“They are so direct in their messaging. They are so clear. They seem unflappable.”\n",
      "Dr. Damour, who has spent her career talking and listening to teenagers, said she believes the Parkland teens are showing the world the potential of their peer group. “Those of us who live with teenagers and are around them can see something that is different about this generation,” she said.\n",
      "There is still much to learn about the postmillennial cohort — social scientists haven’t even agreed on when this generation begins, although there seems to be a consensus forming that the year 2000, give or take a few years, is a good place to start. But data collected from various health surveys already show that today’s teens are different from previous generations in many ways.\n",
      "Many risky behaviors have dropped sharply among today’s teens. Cigarette smoking among teens is at a historic low since peaking in the mid 1990s. Alcohol use has also declined significantly — the number of teens who have used alcohol in the past 30 days is down by half since the 1990s. Teen pregnancy rates have hit historic lows, and teens over all are waiting longer to have sex than their parent’s generation. Teen driving fatalities are down about 64 percent since 1975. Some of that is attributed to safer cars, but teen crashes have declined between 10 and 30 percent in states with tiered licensing systems, and teen drunken driving has dropped while teen seatbelt use has increased.\n",
      "While most health researchers celebrate these changes in teen health, some scientists think the trends suggest a lower level of maturity among today’s teens. Perhaps teens are safer simply because their reliance on social media and smartphone use means they are getting out less. In September, the journal Child Development published a study by Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University, noting that there is a decline in a number of “adult” activities among today’s teens. In seven large, nationally representative surveys of eight million American adolescents from 1976 to 2016, fewer adolescents in recent years are having sex, dating, drinking alcohol, driving, working for pay and going out without their parents.\n",
      "“The big picture is that they are taking longer to grow up,” said Dr. Twenge, whose latest book is “iGen: Why Today’s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy — and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood.”\n",

      "In an article in The Atlantic last fall titled “Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?,” Dr. Twenge argued that teens are more comfortable in their bedrooms or on smartphones or social media than at a party. While they are physically safer than past generations as a result, rates of teen depression and suicide are on the rise. “It’s not an exaggeration to describe iGen as being on the brink of the worst mental-health crisis in decades,” she wrote. “Much of this deterioration can be traced to their phones.”\n",
      "But a number of social scientists and adolescent health researchers disagree with that conclusion. While teen depression and suicide rates are worrisome, there is no causal link to show those trends are the result of smartphones and social media. In fact, a  literature review by Unicef researchers in December found that moderate use of digital technology tends to be beneficial for children’s mental well-being, while no use or too much use is associated with a “small negative impact.” The larger issues that affect a child’s well-being are family functioning, social dynamics at school and socio-economic conditions, the report concluded.\n",
      "Don Tapscott, author of “Grown Up Digital,” said he believes today’s teenagers are better communicators than any previous generation. “They didn’t grow up being the passive recipients of somebody else’s broadcast,” he said. “They grew up being interactors and communicators. In the 1960s we had a generation gap. What we have today is a generation lap — they are lapping their parents on the digital track.”\n",

      "The clinical psychologist Wendy Mogel interviewed groups of middle school and high school students around the country in 2015 and 2016 for her new book, “Voice Lessons for Parents: What to Say, How to Say It and When to Listen.” Dr. Mogel spoke with diverse kids from various regions and walks of life, but found herself consistently impressed by their thoughtfulness, how much they liked their parents, and how much they cared about the world around them.\n",
      "“The press and general public like to see them as spoiled and not having to work hard for anything except grades and being very entitled,” Dr. Mogel said. “But they’re courageous, energetic, optimistic and really smart.”\n",
      "Neil Howe, a historian whose books include “Millennials Rising,” said that unlike earlier generations, today’s teens have accepted the structures of society and have learned to work within those boundaries. “They’re very good at using rules to make their point, and they’re absolutely excellent at negotiating with their parents, and negotiating in a reasonable way about how to bend these rules in a way that will make them more effective and give them more space,” he said. “This is not a ‘throw the brick through the window and burn stuff down’ group of kids at all. They’re working very constructively, arm-in-arm with older people they trust, to make big institutions work better and make them stronger and more effective.”\n",
      "Ms. Lythcott-Haims notes that the current crop of teenagers is the first generation to grow up with active shooter drills since kindergarten. “I think what we might have here is a generation that really defines itself by the markers of their childhoods,” she said. “In addition to being marked by these gun violence tragedies, they came to consciousness with a black man in the White House and smartphones in their hands.”\n",
      "What does all this mean for the future of today’s teens? All of the researchers agreed there is still much more to learn about this cohort, but what we know so far is promising.\n",
      "“We are in the process of distilling the data and discerning who they are, but I am excited,” said Ms. Lythcott-Haims. “We don’t know who they will be in their 20s, but already they have agency, the sense of your own existence, your own right to make decisions and your own responsibility for outcomes and consequences. That’s what we need to have to be mentally well. I think these folks could turn out not to be just leaders, but to be a generation that we look back on and end up calling one of the greatest.”\n",

The next day, he announced his disapproval of my idea that schools should have more active shooter training. If I had known he felt this way, I would have told him my story.\n",
      "Fifteen minutes before the dismissal bell, the fire alarm rang and my class was evacuated after an administrator came on the intercom and gave the order. By the time the administrator made the announcement to take shelter in classrooms, we were too far away to turn back. So we kept going. The entire time, teachers were calling for their students to stay close as they tried to count them all. The teachers were calm, so the students tried to stay calm too. My teacher for that class, Ms. Hitchcock, told us to keep walking. It was reassuring when she took attendance and the entire class was present. Ms. Hitchcock provided order in a moment of chaos. I knew at least some of my friends were safe.\n",
      "Our school regularly has fire drills (as we did the morning of the shooting), tornado drills and lockdown drills. Just six weeks ago, my teachers did a training session on active shooter situations, known as Code Red. All doors must be locked, lights are turned off and students are kept in the classrooms away from windows. For any type of emergency or drill, teachers must account for all their students. After the training, the teachers discussed with the students in each of their classes what to do. We were told where to hide and how to evacuate.\n",
      "Not every school has the training we do. Eighteen states do not require their school districts to develop emergency plans, according to the Government Accountability Office. In the rest, 59 percent of districts reported difficulty balancing emergency planning with other priorities. There is no priority higher than saving lives.\n",
      "My teachers’ training saved lives. Teachers frantically yelled for their students to go back into classrooms, saving some who were unknowingly running toward the shooter.\n",
      "Mr. Gard, my math teacher two years ago, evacuated his classroom due to the fire alarm that went off just before the shooting started. But he immediately pulled the students back into his classroom closet when the Code Red was declared. He turned off the lights, locked his classroom door and counted his students. Mr. Gard knew what to do and he saved lives as a result.\n",
      "At the sound of gunshots, one of my teachers last year, Mr. Rospierski, hurried students into locked classrooms, a protocol reinforced in the teacher training sessions. Then he stayed in the hallway to guide eight stranded students away from the shooter, who was in that same hallway.\n",
      "My high school is not the only one to benefit from training for a situation like this. Three months ago, an elementary school in Northern California blocked a shooter from entering classrooms using similar protocols and saving countless lives. Every district can make itself safer through similar training.\n",
      "Active-shooter training is not the panacea to end school shootings. But it is an essential part of keeping schools safe. Whether one supports arming teachers, an assault weapons ban, or any other measure to reduce gun violence, everyone should see that active-shooter training should be part of a program to address school shootings.\n",
      "President Trump is hosting governors from all 50 states to discuss school safety. I urge him to talk to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, who has proposed increasing the amount of training and drills for active shooter scenarios. I ask him to think about my story. I ask him to reconsider his position on this issue.\n",

We’d like to acknowledge longtime participants from YC CLIP, Locust Grove High School in Locust Grove, Ga., and Hoggard High School in Wilmington, N.C., for weighing in strongly this week.\n",

      "In light of recent events, it was no surprise to us that “Do You Think It Is Important for Teenagers to Participate in Political Activism?” was the most popular writing prompt this week. We received excellent comments from students all over the country who organized and participated in the national student walkouts on March 14, as well as those who chose to opt out. Here are their thoughts on the protest and teenagers’ roles in politics:\n",
      "Kate Silver from Wilmington, N.C., shared her experience:\n",
      "On Wednesday March 14th, thousands participated in Nationwide walkouts to protest gun violence and honor the 17 lives lost in the Parkland shooting. Among the participating schools was mine, Hoggard High School. At 10 am when the protests began, hundreds of students marched to the forum with their voices ready to be heard. I came prepared with my “Arms are for Hugging” t-shirt and “No more silence, end gun violence” written on my poster. 17 students were standing on a wooden bench and came forward one by one, passionately representing each of the 17 victims.\n",
      "The experience was amazing. I felt as though anything was possible and that we could make a difference. Seeing so many students vying for change made me proud of my generation. I felt like my father, who years earlier, marched on Washington to protest the Vietnam War. As a teenager, adults look down on us. They see us as hormonal children that only care about themselves. But during the walkout, we showed them that we will not stay silent and afterwards, they were looking up to us.\n",
      "Sydney Durner from Wilmington, N.C., also participated in the walkout, though for a different reason:\n",
      "Teenagers are usually looked down upon in politics, like our opinion doesn’t matter, we don’t know enough about politics to have a say. It’s important for teenagers to be able to speak out for what they believe in. This enforce good political habits, speaking your mind, standing up for what you believe in, participating in voting, etc.\n",
      "I participated in the walkout on Wednesday, March 14th. I don’t necessarily agree with what my school was preaching about. I went to honor the victims. The walkout turned into a ban guns rally. Guns aren’t the problem, it’s the ones behind the trigger that are the problem. In the article “National School Walkout: Thousands Protest Against Gun Violence Across the U.S.,” they mention a 16 year-old who stayed in class during the protest, saying that banning guns isn’t the issue and that the real issue is the people doing it.” That was his way of participating in political activism. He stayed because it’s what he believed in.\n",
      "Teenagers should participate in political activism. It feels good to be a part of something bigger than you could imagine and trying to make a change in the world. In the article “Why Demonstrating is Good for Kids,” it mentions a study in the journal Child Development, teens and young adults who voted, volunteered, or engaged in activism went farther in school and had higher incomes than those who didn’t advocate for change. It is so important that we develop our voices at a young age. It only helps us in the long run.\n",
      "Leah Schwagerl from Wilmington, N.C., was proud of her classmates:\n",
      "Personally, I am proud of all of the adolescents that participated in the walkouts for gun violence or for memorializing the 17 victims of the Parkland shooting. Even if our efforts to promote change are denied by legislation, at least we were able to experience the unity that comes with standing up for what we believe in. I hope that the nation wide walkout sparked adults to see teenagers in a more respectable way. After all, just a week before the walkout I saw an upsetting post on social media that stated something along the lines of “How am I supposed to listen to teenagers talk about gun laws when earlier this year they were eating tide pods?”\n",
      "To conclude, I can say with pride that after my positive experience from the national school walkout, I plan on being a lot more politically active in the years to come. Political activism allows teenagers, adults, and people in general to align their beliefs and engage in the world.\n",
      "Collin from Lawrence was less impressed with his school’s demonstration:\n",
      "I feel like at my school, Walkout was the wrong term. At my school there was a rally. Disappointed. That was my reaction.\n",
      "Disappointed because instead of being a respectful memorial. It was a political charged anti gun rally.\n",
      "Now, there is nothing wrong with expressing your own political beliefs but school is not the place to hold a political protest. I was under the impression there was going to be 17 minutes of silence but what I got was quite the opposite. People with megaphones, yelling and screaming, chanting. It was far from a memorial. Do I think young people should protest? Yes go right ahead but school is not the place. A large portion of people who went to the “rally” didn’t even know why they were there. Conflicted Ideas about guns swarmed around the place. “Ban all guns!” “Ban Assault Rifles” Some people didn’t even know what they stood for. The worse thing about it is, The school can practicality host an anti gun rally, but if a student walks into class wearing a shirt or a hat that portrays their conservative beliefs or lifestyle, they are asked to take it off. It reminds me of a court case we learned about in Civics. Tinker vs Des Moines. This court case ruled that students have the right to protest as long as they don’t disrupt the learning environment. Although the verdict stands true to this day, I don’t see the law being enforced in America’s High Schools.\n",
      "Kalpana from New York, N.Y., was also confused about the message protesters were sending, but remained hopeful:\n",
      "I’m not sure about the message my school was trying to send. I know that the students and teachers believe gun violence is bad, and I do too, but it confuses me why we were not doing 17 minutes of silence. I wish we had. I thought the walkout was supposed to be for students in Parkland, Florida, and we would be supporting them by walking out and doing 17 minutes of silence and reading their names. Instead, we did 20 minutes of shouting and rallying for gun control. The message we were sending out was not “Parkland we sympathize with you” but “NRA, we’re going to take you down!”\n",
      "I do hope, still, that our rallies help convince Trump to make some gun control laws so there will be fewer incidents involving guns.\n",
      "Though some students doubted the effectiveness of the walkouts, Sydney G. from New York thought they had the potential to make a difference:\n",
      "I think that it was very important that us children, the future of our world went out and stood up for something that we believe in. It is very significant that as individuals at this age that we use our voices, because our opinions are very powerful and influential. I believe that we did make a difference just by going out among millions of others to support the people who have suffered and are still suffering and stand up for what we believe in. When I see photos of the other young adults going out and protesting, I feel proud that there is a group of people who are not afraid to share their true feelings to the nation and that there are people who are willing to protect and support each other no matter how frightening it is.\n",
      "As did Cam from Maine, who hoped young people’s voices wouldn’t be silenced by adults:\n",
      "I think that it is more important than ever for teens to participate in political debates and issues. Sadly, we are the generation that has grown up with mass shootings being a norm, and it needs to stop. I think that students taking a stand will make a difference because we are also the next generation of voters.\n",
      "My school had a snow day on the day of the national walkout so we weren’t able to participate, but from what I saw it got plenty of news coverage and attention, which will help with raising awareness even more.\n",
      "Personally, I also believe that teachers and administrators should allow students to have open, honest conversations about what they believe in without punishment. I also think that is wrong to not allow students to walkout and threaten them for standing up for what they believe in.\n",
      "But Derek Han from San Jose, Calif., thought there were better ways for students to voice their concerns:\n",
      "Many problems are being noticed around the country nowadays such as school shootings, and students may want to protest. Recently, there was a peaceful protest on March 14, where students across the nation walked outside of their classrooms in order to spread awareness about the issue of gun violence in schools. As a student, I didn’t take part in the protest as I believed that walking outside of my classroom for 17 minutes was not the best way to spread awareness about the issue and was not the most efficient way to address nationwide problems. I believe that the idea of teenagers trying to spread their opinions on problems is great, but I just think that there are better ways of accomplishing their goal. Spending class time in order to give respect to the murdered students may not have been the best idea. Letting others know about issues through social media and the internet is a great way to spread awareness and still save class time for learning. While the intentions of protesting students or teenagers may be good, I think that some teenagers may be more prone to act on their emotions, and I feel that teenagers may cause something similar to a riot if their opinions are not agreed upon, or if their actions are not recognized.\n",
      "Many students were passionate about teenagers’ involvement in politics, like Hugo Veliz from Providence, R.I., who wrote:\n",
      "Personally, if the teenagers are being active in political issues, we see different aspects and different views on problems being discussed today. Also, what would happen if the issues being discussed today are about the teenagers and the youth? How could they not be apart of that discussion if they are the discussion. For example, the tragic shootout that recently happened in Florida. Would those in danger be silent and not say what is on their mind? It would be unjust. The teenagers of today will be those making those influential decisions of tomorrow. Being quiet will not only danger today, it will also danger the future.\n",
      "Nelly3D from YC CLIP agreed:\n",
      "These days is very important to raise our voices to get changes. I think is important to teach the teenager to participate in political activism because some teenagers do not how good or bad is to fight to get some positive change. Nowadays, some of our teenagers do not know how to choose good decisions, because some parents do not allow that their children grow independently, this makes us create children unable to make their own decisions. Some of them are influence negatively of bad persons. However, some teenager are more mature than an adult. I think that we have to allow the teenagers participate in different way like political activism in this way in this way they get involved in positive things so that they grow up to be wise people with a lot of knowledge and they can take advantage of it in the future. If we want to see in the future good resolve for this country, we as parents have to educate our children. They are our future.\n",
      "Robert Yates from Wilmington, N.C., argued that civic participation is one of the most important things citizens — young and old — can do for their country:\n",
      "I believe that the willingness of teenagers to take a stand against the government is the most important factor in regards to the reversal of the socioeconomic damage previous generations have dealt to our country and planet. I participated in the walkout last week at my high school along with hundreds of others. Many people, though, opted out of the protest to sit in class and do nothing for seventeen minutes. These people have their reasons, the vast majority of which I disagree with, however the one excuse I heard from a few people that frustrated me the most was that they didn’t “waste their time” because “one person won’t make a difference”. This mindset is the antithesis of meaningful change, which is also shared by people such as those that abstain from exercising their right as an American citizen to vote. As the study referenced in the first article stated, both voting and participating in political activism have a high correlation with going far in school and higher incomes, most likely because proactivity lends itself to success more so than complacency. As far as school staff are concerned, I believe they should remain neutral on the topic and allow students to make their own decisions. I felt pressured to not participate last week because my teacher was clearly biased against the protesters. When school staff share their opinion, it can scare students into doing the opposite of what they believe in, which isn’t a good way to acclimate students to taking a stand.\n",

      "Students responded to our Student Opinion question “What Is Your Favorite Type of Art?” with the art and museum exhibits that have moved them most.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Brianna Browning from Wilmington, N.C., enjoys painting:\n",
      "As a painter I enjoy the instant gratification of the colours. However my favorite type of art is underwater “landscaping”; fish tank decorating. No this doesn’t mean Sponge Bob ornaments, but rather live plants and rocks. I currently have a 75 gal aquarium in which I am turning into a self sustainable tank. I currently have moss and anarchis as a foundation for the root mat. In this aquarium I have three freshwater angelfish, two bala sharks, and one chinese algae eater. This will be a hard project as both the angelfish and bala sharks eat live foods. Making this a difficult and demanding type of art as well. The instant gratification is still here, but you also get the rewards of delayed gratification. You also will watch the plants grow and take shape making this a very natural serene piece of art.\n",
      "Grant Holland from Wilmington, N.C., prefers art that has a purpose:\n",
      "I tend to favor artwork that shows meaning. Anyone can just paint, sculpt or take a picture of something, but what is hard is to show the audience your view and meaning through the art. I usually do not attend art museums, but instead I read the National Geographic magazine or watch the Discovery channel which contains videos and photography that is breathtaking. Discovery and National Geographic do not just run around taking pictures of anything. They take pictures of things that show meaning, like understanding the harsh life of someone who lives in Cuba which shows the reader the importance of freedom. Or watching an animal rescue program release an animal back into the wild that has recovered from injury which shows that humans can make a change on animal life. Art needs to have a meaning, to make a successful piece of artwork, give it life.\n",
      "Jordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., also favors art with cultural significance:\n",
      "I like art that evolves and follows the times that we are living in. Graffiti art is one of my favorites, along with political art and graphic designs. Art is no longer just a painting of fruit, it is one of the most valuable tools used to express ideas. Something that conveys a reaction out of the viewer, that is provocative and eye opening is art in it’s most pure of form.\n",
      "Sarah Dill from Maine appreciates the variety of interpretations different media invite:\n",
      "I like to experience art because it kind of gives you a different perspective. There are so many different forms of art that you could have one topic and there could be so many different perspectives on it. I also like it because it’s cool to look at and you can interpret the meaning of the piece and what the artist was going for.\n",
      " Shaunna Dancause from Massachusetts uses technology to get a museum experience at home:\n",
      "With the internet making what seems to be everything so readily available, art can be viewed without needing to look at a book or go to a museum. For instance, I spend lots of time looking at art on Instagram. It is especially exciting because you can discover young and underappreciated artists that you wouldn’t have the joy of knowing about otherwise. That being said, it is a very different experience compared to visiting a museum. Being able to see art up close and personal is the best way to view it. My favorite type of art is definitely illustration because it almost always breaks the norms of realism. Even at seventeen, I enjoy looking at children’s picture books for the illustrations. It doesn’t matter whichever method you are using to look at the art, all that matters is that you’re able to appreciate it.\n",
      "John Burgee from Wilmington, N.C., thinks our world would be boring without the gift of art:\n",
      "My favorite piece of art was Kehinde Wiley’s “Margaret, Countess of Blessington.” I liked this painting for it’s uniqueness and realism which I find to be important in a successful work of art. Although I’ve only been to an art museum once or twice I can consider myself a good drawer and I can recognize a good drawing/painting when I see one.\n",

      "For our “Extreme Times, Extreme Clothes” Picture Prompt, we asked what you think fashion says about culture — if anything at all.\n",
      "Emma Claire Lisk from Wilmington, N.C., thinks that, as with all art forms, fashion can make a statement about the world we live in:\n",
      "My friends and I participated in a local fashion contest where the entire outfit was produced from books. But, one of my friend’s creations truly showed the mindset of a fashion designer. Towards her waist, one side had black spikes and the other had a soft feathered curve. She used these additions to display the tensions between people in society.\n",
      "Current events have affected fashion since the 20th century. It has been shown through Martin Margiela in the ‘80s, the time of the infamous stock market crash called Black Monday, by pushing his designs to be “purposefully made to look poor — because the world suddenly was.”\n",
      "Olivia Rotondo from Philadelphia sees fashion more as a personal choice:\n",
      "Fashion is a way that people express themselves. People use outfits to represent who they are. I think that what people personally chose to wear does not reflect what is happening in the world. Some people would rather wear sweats and some people would rather wear jeans, it is just a preference between people.\n",
      "Andrew Derushia from Wilmington, N.C., noted that clothes have helped propel significant cultural shifts throughout history:\n",
      "Times change fast nowadays. We were one thing and it out of style in two weeks. I feel this fast paced world is a result of how we change as humans in our many ever-evolving ways. Clothes have always represented something for it’s wearers. In the late 1700’s the rich would envelope themselves in rare animals skins and elaborate colorful dyed fabrics. All this superfluous clothing would depict the wealth of these people. Today the wealth in clothing is still seen but not nearly as much. We see less of a gap because clothes are more attainable for those “ballin on a budget”.\n",
      "Clothes today also have swayed away from belonging to one gender allowing this cross over to show how society’s acceptance has grown for those who don’t want to follow their gender stereotypes allow them to explore brighter colors, fun cuts, and patterns of clothes originally designated for a sole purpose. The closing gaps between men and women, rich and wealth, and black and white has allowed our communities to grow more unified while still allowing one to express themselves. Fashion overall has helped express the need for dismembering concepts that have configured a larger divide between different groups and allowed us to be seen as more equals with a nice pop of color to show everyone who we truly are.\n",

      "Morgan from North Carolina created a back story for the image:\n",
      "The children knew they needed to help their cat. The cat’s tail had been cut when she was after a red bird. The bird had decided to fight back this time. The children figured they should tape the cat’s tail, but literally got too wrapped up in their work to accomplish much the first time. They finally managed to do the job and were almost able to get away with it.\n",
      "Mandi from North Carolina began her story this way:\n",
      "Leah, Cassie, and George were sitting on their couch, bored, not being able to do anything because the storm had caused the power to go out, making the tv go out and their phones and laptops dead. Their mother was stuck in traffic where a car had crashed from going too fast on the road.\n",
      "“I’m bored, what should we do?” George asked, laying on the floor looking up at the ceiling.\n",
      "After a few minutes of silence, Cassie, the middle child, jumped up. “What if we played with Ms. Lake’s cats, there is one outside!”\n",
      "“Yeah,” Leah, the oldest child answered. “we’d be doing the cat a favor and getting her out of the rain anyway.”\n",
      "After getting the cat out of the rain, which George was left to do the job, losing a rock paper scissors fight. Cassie ran out of the bathroom with some bandages. “Let’s make a cat mummy!” she yelled, a beaming smile on her face.\n",
      "The siblings soon had the bandages everywhere, more on themselves than the cat. They heard the door open. “What are you guys doing? Why is there a cat?” Their mother was shocked.\n",
      "“We were bored, and the cat was outside, so we brought her in and tried to make her into a mummy.” George replied.\n",
      "“if you were bored you could’ve played board games! I told you this over the phone!”\n",
      "“Oh yeah.” the children said, looking at their feet.\n",

      "Sean from Sacramento imagined this:\n",
      "It would have been amazing if Oprah had included herself in her list of Earth’s best “warriors.”\n",
      "Hayley DeArmond said more could be done to make the film enjoyable:\n",
      "There are a lot of problems with making film adaptations of popular books. Directors and writers are largely limited by things such as in the case as A Wrinkle in Time not including the book’s scientific theories. Since the story already has been heard, filmmakers are pressured to make it stay as true to the source material as possible, but that is what it is: source material. Ava DuVernay tries to add an artist touch with the casting, but I do not think it does enough to make the film enjoyable. To those who read the book, parts are missing; but the efforts to make the film like the book also made it confusing and not answer a lot of questions to those who did not read the book. An important thing to think about is the movie I, Robot is based on a series of short stories, and The Minority Report was based on short story. Many people do not realize how little of a book you can fit in a movie, but short stories give that message, characters, and setting to make something good. Speaking of The Minority Report it was directed by Steven Spielberg, not just one of the best directors, but directors of film adaptations. War Horse, Catch Me If You Can, The Color Purple, Jurassic Park, Schindler’s List, Jaws, the list keeps going; the most notable thing is Spielberg finds the importance of the story and expresses it his own way in film, he is not debating which chapters to include or characters to cut, he is creating a film\n",

      "Here is what two students said for our Picture Prompt “March Madness”:\n",
      "Rex Hardy from Wilmington, N.C., is a regular bracket participant:\n",
      "I’ve done the March Madness Bracket Challenge with friends over the past couple of years and it never turns out the way I’ve predicted it. This year in particular, I had Virginia in the Final Four and North Carolina winning the whole shebang. After this past weekend, my bracket was destroyed by teams I’ve never heard of, terrible blowouts, and crazy buzzer beaters. It’s March Madness for a reason; which, is one thing I fail to understand year after year. I always predict the higher ranked team winning the majority of the games with only one or two upsets, yet I’m always proven wrong. The Cinderella story always finds a way to mess up what I had planned. This year is definitely up for grabs. Deep inside, I agree with Josh Nagel in that Duke has the best team and is the biggest threat to win it all; yet, I could definitely be wrong. If this year has proved anything to me it is that anybody can be beat on any given day. Virginia, being the favor to win it all by experts and millions of others, were quickly eliminated by a county team. This being said, I believe Texas A&M could win it all with their lineup of two 6’10” forwards, but they might not. The championship is up for grabs and the better team day in and day out is going to win. At this point, the world is wondering, who will it be?\n",
      "Olivia Rotondo from Philadelphia follows the game closely:\n",
      "This 2018 NCAA March Madness has been full of amazing wins and disappointing upsets. As many people pick Virginia or UNC to win it all, most brackets are now busted. I do not follow basketball closely, I know as much as the common person. So, my bracket was not going to get far anyways. I have a place in my heart for Nova. I can’t wait to see who will win this year!\n",

      "SadiaD4 from YC CLIP named Stephen Hawking as a forward-thinking innovator:\n",
      "The well-known scientist Stephen William Hawking, he was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist and author and he is well known for his future prediction. One of his recent predictions about earth is, ‘Earth will glow red and become as hot as Venus. In July 2017, he told BBC that humanity is at a “tipping point” where global warming would become so bad that Earth become like Venus, with a temperature of 250 degrees Celsius, and raining sulfuric acid’. However, some people think that prediction is not going to happen. They think Venus is so close to the Sun but Earth is not that much close. Furthermore, for the increasing of global warming it could happen in the future.\n",
      "Liubov4D from YC CLIP mentioned Elon Musk:\n",
      "A name of the one person, who could be rightfully named as a person ahead of the present time, comes to my mind. This person’s name is Elon Musk. Inspired by Isaac Asimov’s “Foundation” he tries “to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one.” The same way as sailors roamed the seas, discovering new continents, Musk plans to expand into the space and colonize Mars in 2022. Being bullied in childhood, being sneered as an adult, Elon Musk with the child passion in his soul, is the unique gifted personality, who definitely will influence the existence of all human species.\n",
      "Jessica Brevil from Wekiva High, Apopka, Fla., noted the printer is a time-sensitive invention:\n",
      "Time controls effectiveness of innovation, as seen in the article, which is the reason why the statement that “Ideas do not exist only on their own merits. Timing matters.”. The fact is that certain things are simply not needed for their time. A printer was not needed centuries before the adoption of education systems and this innovation would seem useless in the past while it is essential in modern schools.\n",

      "“Is Childhood Today Too Risk-Free?” was our second most popular prompt of the week. Students were mostly in agreement that childhood is too risk-free, although many said their own parents encouraged some kinds of risk, so didn’t count themselves in the overly protected category. Other students were aghast at the images of the playground in the article, and hoped for more of a natural and safer playground setting for children.\n",
      "Alyssa from Georgia said childhood is sterilized today:\n",
      "I think kids should learn about and experience risk at a young age, so they learn from it and won’t make that mistake again. I do think childhood is really sterilized today, parents should let their child have a little freedom to make mistakes and learn from them.\n",
      "Haleigh from Georgia said children learn from their mistakes:\n",
      "When I was a kid and played on the play ground it was safe to play on but we still managed to get hurt. Although we got hurt, we learned from it and never did the same thing again. I think this play ground is a little too risk taking for kids to play on but I also agree to making play ground a little risk just so the kids can learn from their mistakes. When you introduce risk at a young age kids learn at an early age to where they won’t do it again. I have been exposed to risk but I think I could’ve and should’ve been exposed to more; I would’ve learned more from my mistakes than I do because I haven’t been in those risky situations. With that being said I believe that this play ground is a good idea for young kids to be exposed to risks that they can learn from.\n",
      "Sneezy from Kaiserslautern, Germany, said risk is good for children:\n",
      "I feel that childhood today is too risk-free. The playgrounds that I grew up on were, what I would say, were the standard one; it had the slide, monkey bars, and these little spinny disk things comparable to merry-go-rounds. This playground didn’t compare at all to the “risk-enhanced’ ones. Some of the benefits that these risk-enhanced playgrounds have over traditional ones is that kids will be able to test their limits, how else will they know when to stop? These kids could be building a thin beam to walk across and fall out and hurt themselves. Yes, they did hurt themselves, but they learned that it did, and, hopefully at least, won’t do it again. And honestly, you can hurt yourself on any playground, risky or not.\n",
      "Derrik A. Mullin Jr from Kaiserslautern, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, agreed:\n",
      "I’m sick of kids being coddled and having everything sugar coated for them. When I was younger and we had money problems or family issues, I knew and was appreciative of the fact that my parents told me things straight and raw. I learned to keep myself busy with what we had. Now do I like video games and all that new, safe, indoors stuff? Of course I do. That doesn’t mean that playgrounds, sand boxes, mud pies, and wood carving weren’t what made me an early 2000s child, what made me who I am today. I didn’t get my first phone till I was 13 while I now see 6 year-olds with iPhones and tablets in their hands. You’re asking me if I think today’s children live a life too posh? Too risk free? Of course I do! They have everything bad in the world hid from them, they stay inside, they watch TV instead of going out with friends! Nothing is appreciated about the outdoors by the millennials of today, they’re too worried about their makeup, when the next iPhone is gonna come out, or how pretty they look in the mornings. I’m not at all suggesting children shouldn’t have any access to electronics or a somewhat safer environment, or that you should be telling them you’re gonna end up living in a car at the end of the month, but tell them when you don’t have enough money to buy them something, make sure they know how they look matters doesn’t matter and that they’ll always be gorgeous no matter what anyone else says.\n",
      "Bella Cankurtaran from Wilmington, N.C., did not enjoy viewing the images of the playground in the article:\n",
      "I’m pretty sure I shuddered while viewing the images of these British playgrounds. Recess is a time to let out all your energy in a colorful wonderland. The playgrounds these kids are exposed to look like prisons or some sort of war camp. These are children we are talking about! Their mind isn’t fully capable of understanding the risks put in front of them and actually learning from them. We develop that skill over time. Even today, I still make the same mistakes and get hurt each time. The article reported that a placard for Princess Diana Playground purposely provides risks “‘so that your child can develop an appreciation of risk in a controlled play environment rather than taking similar risks in an uncontrolled and unregulated wider world’”. No matter how much adult supervision there is, they can’t keep an eye on every child. Children get hurt on a regular playground so getting hurt on the British playgrounds will be a severely worse case. Nothing will stop kids from doing crazy things. They don’t know what to expect if they jump off a wooden crate or run their finger along the “sharp-edged tape dispenser”, and making that an option for them at this age can be fatal. Each day these children are exposed to danger that could possibly end their life and they can’t learn from that if they’re dead.\n",
      "Mary Wells from Wilmington, N.C., said exposure is very important to growth:\n",
      "When I was a child, I always looked forward to going outside to play with my friends on the playground. My favorite part was being able to swing like an animal across the monkey bars and see how far I could go in 30 seconds. Today, looking at this article, I find playgrounds in Europe are changing what we used to know as playgrounds into ones that have high risk factors. This is scary for younger children, who need security in their early years. Introducing risk factors not only shows them that it is okay to wander onto these dangerous sites, but also that it is encouraged. Children are at the stage where their minds are constantly changing and they hold on to information they receive. I believe that they should not be exposed to this environment at a young age because it teaches them that they should take high risks. In some situations, this is beneficial because they learn to take chances and not be afraid to try new things, but it also could be very dangerous for these little humans, who have not been in this world for very long. We take the time to show younger kids innocent videos and television, so why would we expose them to an environment that is not safe?\n",
      "anon1010 from Cincinnati said a feeling of being independent from adults is important for children:\n",
      "I think suburban areas are too sterilized. City kids still have opportunity for risk in their built environment and rural kids still have the unprotected woods for risky play. When I was in school, all the playground equipment was installed on asphalt — no rubber mats or mulch. Kids would jump off from the swings at the height of the swing or the merry-go-round at its fastest and land on pavement. There were occasional skinned knees, but no serious injuries. The bolder and more athletic would go on to more daring feats and everyone else learned their limits. The drawback of returning some risk is litigation. I grew up in the 70’s and I think I had the right amount of risk and freedom. It allowed me to separate from the adults in my life. Without risk during the young years, it seems that teens have been infantilized and are reluctant to try more adult activities (i.e. driving).\n",

      "MIAMI — Starting in the fall of 2017, David Hogg, a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School senior, applied to a half-dozen universities that offered programs in journalism, political science or photography. His plan was to become a journalist or filmmaker.\n",
      "Less than six months later, the Parkland, Fla., teenager had tragically become one of the best-known high school students in America. After 17 of his fellow students and teachers were killed in a Feb. 14 mass shooting, Mr. Hogg became a leader in the grass-roots, student-led gun control movement that spread around the country, pushing a campaign to hold lawmakers accountable for their votes on gun legislation.\n",
      "The day after the shooting, Mr. Hogg got his first college application letter back: a rejection from California State University at Long Beach. At least two more denials followed, along with acceptances to three universities. Now Mr. Hogg, whose name and face are surely recognizable to college admissions officers everywhere, has no idea where or if he is going to college in the fall.\n",
      "“Sure, it’s disappointing and annoying, but not surprising. There are a lot of amazing people who do not get into or go to college,” said Mr. Hogg, who carries a 4.2 GPA and scored 1270 on the SAT. “I wanted to make a difference through storytelling and political activism, but I am already doing that now.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The Parkland students are a case study in civic engagement. They are among the leaders of the #NeverAgain movement, collectively delivering fiery speeches that demand change, promoting their message on social media and organizing the March for Our Lives rally held last weekend, which drew participants from across the globe.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Much of their leadership and community work, driven by the loss of classmates and friends, might not have been considered in the college admission process. Now, some of the most vocal Parkland seniors — whether accepted or denied to their top college choices — are rethinking their college plans, hoping in one way or another to capitalize on the momentum.\n",
      "Samantha Fuentes, who was wounded by a bullet and shrapnel in the Parkland attack, is contemplating sitting out the first semester or even the full year to continue the campaign to promote more rigorous gun safety laws.\n",
      "“If the movement is solidifying even more and hitting the nation from all directions and they need soldiers, I will put college off,” said Ms. Fuentes, 18, who is staying close to home with tentative plans to attend Broward Community College, then Florida Atlantic University.\n",
      "As a shooting victim and survivor, she is willing to speak at universities or to politicians about gun legislation.\n",
      "“The truth is, us kids, we just want to be the voice for the people we lost, or for people who don’t think they have a voice,” said Ms. Fuentes, who would like to eventually become an elementary schoolteacher. “I am prioritizing this over college right now, I am prioritizing people’s lives over my education.”\n",
      "University admissions offices declined to discuss individual applications, but many noted that civic engagement is a plus in considering whether to admit an applicant. In fact, some colleges publicly assured high school applicants in advance of last weekend’s March for Our Lives rallies that their participation in peaceful protests would not harm admission chances.\n",
      "Harvard, for example, issued a statement: “The mission of Harvard College is to provide a deeply transformative liberal arts and sciences education that will prepare our students for a life of citizenship and leadership. Fundamental to our mission is our belief that students have the right to protest peacefully about issues of concern to them. Students who are disciplined for engaging responsibly in exercising their rights and freedoms would not have their chances of admission compromised or their admissions revoked.”\n",

      "Advertisement\n",
      "“We are trying to get these laws changed to drive down the number of people who die by gun violence,” he said. “I can figure out everything else later.”\n",
      "Mr. Hogg said he does not believe his outspokenness had anything to do with the college denials, but admits it has been frustrating. In a late-night, March 16 message on Twitter — liked by at least 64,000 and retweeted nearly 6,600 times — Mr. Hogg told his followers, “Just got rejected from another college but that’s ok we’re already changing the world. Goodnight everyone.”\n",
      "He added that he was comforting himself by eating chocolate muffins. The response was mixed, with some mocking his rejection, some encouraging him to take a gap year and others touting him as precisely the type of student colleges should recruit.\n",
      "After a Twitter follower suggested he apply to a California university, Mr. Hogg confirmed that one of the schools that denied his application was University of California, San Diego. The University of California, Los Angeles, also turned him down, he said later.\n",
      "On Wednesday morning, Laura Ingraham, the conservative radio host, taunted Mr. Hogg by linking to a story on Twitter about his college application denials. “David Hogg Rejected by Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it,” she said. Mr. Hogg pushed back, calling for sponsors to boycott Ms. Ingraham’s show. He later posted a list of advertisers to his nearly 600,000 followers, and Ms. Ingraham on Thursday apologized on Twitter.\n",
      "“Any student should be proud of a 4.2 GPA,” including Mr. Hogg, she wrote. “On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland.”\n",
      "Ryan Deitsch, a Parkland classmate who wants to follow his father and grandfather into filmmaking and photography, said his applications were rejected from several schools, including U.C.L.A. and Northwestern University. He was admitted to Florida State University, Savannah College of Art and Design and Columbia College Chicago.\n",
      "“I don’t know what the next couple of months will look like. Right now, we are ramped up and the world is watching so now is the time for us to act,” Mr. Deitsch, 18, said just hours after a phone interview with Columbia College Hollywood, which is not affiliated with the Chicago school. “To do that, some of us might have to change our original plans. Right now, I am thinking of taking at least a semester off to devote to the movement.”\n",
      "Though the shooting and organized response thrust Parkland students into the spotlight, Mr. Deitsch, a student journalist who filmed students in the aftermath of the shooting, does not believe it entitles him to special college privileges.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“It’s disappointing to not get into certain schools, but I try to keep things in perspective,” he said. “I am not angry. If I didn’t qualify then I shouldn’t just be admitted because I spoke the loudest. There is much more important work for us to do.”\n",

      "In 2000, Ta-Nehisi Coates and Kamilah Forbes shared a moment of intense pain. Their friend and former classmate Prince Jones had been shot to death by a police officer in Virginia. Mr. Coates wrote in his 2015 book “Between the World and Me” that after learning the news he dropped off his infant son with Ms. Forbes — called “Aunt Kamilah” in the book — so he could attend Jones’s funeral. “I sat there feeling myself a heretic, believing only in this one-shot life and the body,” he wrote.\n",
      "Now, 18 years later, Mr. Coates and Ms. Forbes will reconvene in Harlem as she adapts and directs the world premiere stage adaptation of “Between the World and Me” at the Apollo Theater. They’ve come a long way since then, with many achievements to their names: Mr. Coates is a MacArthur fellow, while Ms. Forbes is the executive producer for the Apollo. But they hope to conjure the visceral anger and grief they felt right after Jones’s death to galvanize a society still besieged by gun violence and discrimination.\n",
      "“It’s unfortunate that every single week there is another world event that happens that makes the language even more relevant,” Ms. Forbes said in an interview.\n",
      "The production will run for two nights, April 2 and 3, before traveling to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., on April 7. It won’t quite be a play or a straight recitation of the celebrated book, which won the National Book Award and was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. Excerpts and fragments will be read either solo or in groups by a cast that includes the actress Angela Bassett and the rappers Common and Black Thought. Projections visualizing Mr. Coates’s vivid imagery will tower behind them, and the jazz musician Jason Moran will perform a live score with a trio.\n",
      "“How do we, in an overwhelming, arresting, and gorgeously beautiful way, illuminate all that the book is?” Ms. Forbes said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Back in 2015, as soon as Ms. Forbes finished the book, she knew she wanted to turn it into a stage production. The only thing in her way was Mr. Coates himself. “My recollection is I didn’t want to do it,” he said in a phone interview. “When ‘Between the World and Me’ came out, a lot of people had ideas for things, and I was just really tired and kind of suspicious.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "It was his longstanding friendship with Ms. Forbes that softened his stance and led him to award her the stage rights. They met in 1994, when Ms. Forbes was a freshman at Howard University and Mr. Coates was a sophomore; they helped organize a hip-hop and poetry cypher on campus that year and remained close ever since. “Knowing Kam, there’s nobody else I would have trusted to do it,” Mr. Coates said.\n",
      "But rather than providing input, Mr. Coates decided to remove himself from the process entirely and give Ms. Forbes full artistic control. When Ms. Forbes tried showing Mr. Coates some of the more aggressive edits, he declined to look at all. “Kam has the freedom to pursue her truth. She don’t need me breathing down her neck,” he said, adding jokingly: “I’ll give you my review next week. We’ll see if this friendship is still a thing.”\n",
      "At a rehearsal at the Apollo on Friday, Mr. Moran sat at a grand piano on a platform far above the stage, attacking taut arpeggio patterns with the bassist Mimi Jones and the drummer Nate Smith. Mr. Moran, a MacArthur fellow and composer behind the score for the 2014 film “Selma,” nonetheless approached the project with trepidation. “I usually think that nothing needs music because I love silence so much,” he said.\n",
      "Onstage, his anxious chords matched the book’s seething tone and simmering tension. “What I like about the book is that there’s no soft edge on it,” Mr. Moran said. “I’m trying to make sure I don’t soften anything up.” Behind and below him, the projections, by the artist Tal Yarden, flashed across multiple screens, showing the smiling face of Prince Jones, or two black hands outstretched in surrender or protest.\n",
      "To adapt the book, Ms. Forbes enlisted two dramaturges, Lauren A. Whitehead and Talvin Wilks, who faced the challenge of paring down a text that, under 200 pages, was already concise. They decided to use the poetry technique of erasure, which consists of blacking out portions of a larger text, to expose terse emotional outbursts and visually arresting moments.\n",
      "In his book, for example, Mr. Coates wrote about Jones’s murder: “This entire episode took me from fear to a rage that burned in me then, animates me now, and will likely leave me on fire for the rest of my days.”\n",
      "In the production, the sentence became: “This entire episode took me from fear to / rage / Fire for the rest of my days.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The process stripped away Mr. Coates’s sober tone, Ms. Whitehead said, revealing that “there was actually a voice of rage.”\n",
      "Ms. Forbes and the two dramaturges started to develop the work at an intensive two-week residency at Sundance in December along with four actors, including the Tony-nominated actress Michelle Wilson (“Sweat”), who will perform in Monday’s show. The reading sessions were filled with discussions, arguments and crying.\n",

      "“The first day was so emotionally and spiritually exhausting,” Ms. Wilson said.\n",
      "Eventually, the team whittled down the book into a 90-minute presentation consisting of 21 excerpts from the book. The cast, which will be different for each performance and includes Susan Kelechi Watson, Joe Morton and Pauletta Washington, will not memorize lines but rather will rely on scripts onstage to channel the effect of reading something powerful for the first time.\n",
      "Some excerpts will be read verbatim, while other poetic passages will be less recognizable, with dialogue being passed back and forth among actors. One of those moments, which captures Mr. Coates’ whirlwind education at Howard, “relies on overlap and speed,” Ms. Whitehead said. “You have this feeling of vertigo, which is what he was experiencing when he was learning all these other black narratives he had never heard before.”\n",
      "In Harlem, the production will be seen by thousands, including the one person the book was meant for originally. Mr. Coates said that his son, Samori, whom “Between the World and Me” is addressed to, will be in the audience. He will watch as an intensely personal letter will be transformed into a communal performance.\n",
      "Though there are no concrete plans for further shows, Ms. Forbes said she will observe how the text from three years ago plays to an already drastically changed world and think about how the project could continue and evolve.\n",
      "“If there isn’t an immediate resonant response, for at least the work we’ve set out to do, we’ve got to change it,” she said. “It’s not just a reflection: I see this work as a call to action.”\n",

      "From a soaring skyscraper to the wide span of a bridge, landmarks and buildings around the world are often called upon as torchbearers of grief after mass tragedies.\n",
      "The Eiffel Tower in Paris went dark after a bomb attack in October that killed hundreds of people in Somalia. The spire of 1 World Trade Center in New York was lit up in rainbow colors last year, one of many buildings to reflect the mourning over the dozens killed in a nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla.\n",
      "And starting Wednesday, one month after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, at least 52 buildings and other structures in 19 states and the nation’s capital will be lit up in orange for up to 58 nights — one night for each person killed in the massacre.\n",
      "The campaign was initiated by Scott H. Rechler, the chairman and chief executive of RXR Realty, which owns and operates buildings in the New York area. It was organized with the help of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit group that aims to reduce gun violence in the United States, where 33,000 people are killed by gunfire every year.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In an interview, Mr. Rechler said he wanted to keep a dialogue about gun control and gun violence going after the Las Vegas shooting. “I began to realize that maybe this is a way to make a statement to keep it in people’s minds — that it hasn’t been resolved,” he said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“These are iconic buildings that are very visible,” Mr. Rechler added. “It raises awareness.”\n",
      "The buildings and structures cover the country, from the San Diego Museum of Man, across the Rocky Mountains to the Boulder Courthouse in Colorado, to the Skydance Pedestrian Bridge in Oklahoma City, and further east to the Helmsley Building and 4 Times Square in New York.\n",
      "Illuminating a recognizable part of a city’s skyline in symbolic lights sends a message of solidarity from a community, Mr. Rechler said. The ZACH Theater in Austin, Tex., is one such structure associated with the heart of a hometown.\n",

      "It will do so again on Wednesday, but this time in orange, said Elisbeth Challener, its managing director.\n",
      "The theater “has been a significant part of the Austin community for 85 years now,” Ms. Challener said in an email. “We think of ourselves as a meeting tent where the community comes together.”\n",
      "The color orange came to symbolize the push to end gun violence after a Chicago teenager, Hadiya Pendleton, was shot dead in her hometown a week after performing at Barack Obama’s second inauguration in 2013.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“In some ways, it is like a candle, and we use candles to honor people,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety.\n",
      "Some buildings are lit up in orange for a few nights each June to mark National Gun Violence Awareness Day. But Mr. Feinblatt said he hoped that since the current campaign would last for a longer period of time, it would linger as a reminder of the human toll of gun violence while debates on gun control legislation, including a ban on bump stocks, proceed on federal and state levels.\n",
      "Not everyone Mr. Rechler reached out to in a letter was on board. The organizations behind some buildings agreed to join for one or a few days of the campaign, while those who declined entirely spoke of the sensitivity of taking on a political position, he said.\n",
      "Benjamin Barbera, the curator and operations manager at the Milwaukee County Historical Society, said that starting on Wednesday, orange lights would shine up from below to fill the vaulted windows on the building’s second floor in tribute to the Las Vegas victims.\n",
      "But the lights will probably be swapped out soon after for other coming events and holidays.\n",
      "Still, the show of architectural solidarity was expected to have an impact. The building, built in 1913, is a large, wedge-shaped structure that is visible from downtown, and is highly recognizable since local television stations point their weather cameras at it.\n",
      "“It will be fairly striking for Milwaukee residents to see we are engaging in this tribute or memorial,” Mr. Barbera said.\n",

      "Ms. Wintour was right. After a couple of meetings, Ms. Kuryk knew the finance game was not for her.\n",
      "Instead, Ms. Kuryk soon found herself back at Condé Nast, no longer looking for a job but serving as Vogue’s director of communications, and the media gatekeeper to Ms. Wintour (who doubles as the artistic director of Condé Nast).\n",
      "But in June, Ms. Kuryk decided to strike out on her own and start a consulting film, Artemis Strategies, which she is pitching to clients as a vehicle to help them craft their message for socially aware consumers.\n",
      "“People have been giving away money generously for decades. That’s not in dispute,” Ms. Kuryk, 40, said during a recent interview in the office she now rents from Condé Nast at 1 World Trade Center. “I can help consumer-facing companies deepen their civic engagement and tell their value story better.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Those companies also need to navigate potential pitfalls. As the firm’s website states, “In an unpredictable political landscape brands need to be acutely aware and cautious who they align with.”\n",
      "Ms. Wintour, for one, seems to think starting a consulting firm is a good career move for Ms. Kuryk. “You could say we took a risk hiring Hildy back in 2013 — she came from politics and made no pretense that she knew much about the fashion world,” she said. “But the risk paid off. Hildy is smart, a quick study, and, best of all, her judgment is sound.”\n",
      "Ms. Kuryk has two simultaneous goals with Artemis. The first is to make sure brands like Pepsi never release another ad like 2017’s disastrous conflation of Kendall Jenner, protest and the Black Lives Matter movement. The second is to reinvent the concept of corporate social responsibility by integrating it into every aspect of a company’s management, and not shunt it off, she said, to “a separate office down the hall.”\n",
      "Partly because of the reach of social media, partly because of a new era of civic engagement (some of it in response to the polarizing first year of the Trump administration), corporations are increasingly embracing message-based marketing. Examples include Nickelodeon’s going off the air for 17 minutes in solidarity with victims of gun violence, McDonald’s turning its golden arches upside down to mark International Women’s Day.\n",
      "“Companies are being asked and demanded to state their values,” Ms. Kuryk said. “And how they seize this moment could pay massive business and messaging dividends for them.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But not all such moves have gone smoothly, from that short-lived Pepsi commercial to the widely criticized Ram commercial, aired during the Super Bowl this year, that used a sermon from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to sell trucks, to the criticism (by, among others, Chance the Rapper) of Heineken’s series of commercials for its light beer and the tagline, “Sometimes, Lighter Is Better.”\n",
      "“The Pepsi and Kendall Jenner thing — I was tearing my hair out,” Ms. Kuryk said. “I wanted to be there long before they shot it so I could say: ‘Hey, guys, I know some people. Let’s call them.’”\n",

      "Born and raised in Manhattan, Ms. Kuryk graduated from Vanderbilt with a degree in political science. She worked in Bill Clinton’s White House and as a fund-raiser for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign before joining the finance wing of the Democratic National Committee.\n",
      "With her business not yet a year old, Ms. Kuryk has picked up some splashy clients, including Nordstrom (a company about to open the first Manhattan location for its flagship brand, a men’s wear shop, at 235 West 57th), the news briefing service the Skimm, as well as Condé Nast, with a focus on Vogue and its high-profile Met Gala.\n",
      "Ms. Kuryk’s experience of toggling between the private and public sectors could help her take advantage of the openings in a rapidly developing market.\n",
      "“There’s huge demand right now for professionals who can teach businesses how to navigate these new consumer expectations and for corporations to take stances on political issues and practice good corporate social responsibility,” said Kara Alaimo, assistant professor of public relations at Hofstra University.\n",
      "“What’s astonishing is that we’re consistently seeing major brands who can’t seem to apply basic principles of how to make decisions when they’re taking stances on political issues,” she added.\n",
      "And it will only become more important. A recent paper titled “The Dawn of CEO Activism,” published by the public relations giant Weber Shandwick, noted that millennials — consumers ages 18 to 35 — showed the greatest positive response to corporate activism.\n",
      "Which raises a question: Isn’t this more of a gig for an actual millennial?\n",
      "“You can’t have a millennial do this job, because you need someone who actually has some real experience — up and down,” Ms. Kuryk said.\n",
      "Dr. Alaimo backed her up: “My feeling is you do want a seasoned professional. It’s not a case where a millennial can intuit what will work. You want to be making decisions based on research and best practices.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "And having some very well-known names in her corner can’t hurt.\n",
      "“She treats everyone with respect and appreciation for the value of the role they play,” said Valerie Jarrett, the former senior White House adviser to Mr. Obama, who has worked closely with Ms. Kuryk over the years. “That’s the skill set that will make her very effective with clients.”\n",

      "For the latest news in the wake of the Florida school shooting, read Wednesday’s coverage.\n",
      "CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. — Driven by rage and grief over one of the deadliest school shootings in modern American history, students from across the country were taking action in hopes of pushing their lawmakers to rethink their positions on gun control, even as the Florida State House rejected a move on Tuesday to consider a bill that would ban assault rifles.\n",
      "From California to Florida, teenagers walked out of classes, stopped traffic and made stirring speeches calling out their elders for inaction.\n",
      "Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed last week, traveled on Tuesday to Tallahassee, the state capital, to call for an assault weapons ban. The direct appeal to the Legislature follows protests outside schools, social media appeals and national television appearances.\n",
      "• Assault rifles have become a particular target of the latest gun-control campaign. The police say the suspect in last week’s massacre, Nikolas Cruz, was able to kill 17 people in just six minutes by wielding a semiautomatic weapon, an AR-15 rifle.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "• President Trump on Tuesday ordered the Justice Department to propose regulations to ban so-called bump stocks, which can convert a semiautomatic gun into an automatic weapon like the one used last year in the Las Vegas shooting. Read more on how they work.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "• A Washington Post/ABC News opinion poll released on Tuesday showed that 77 percent of Americans believe the Republican-controlled Congress is not doing enough to prevent mass shootings, with 62 percent saying President Trump has not done enough. On Monday, the White House indicated that  Mr. Trump was open to supporting a bipartisan effort to revise federal background checks for prospective gun buyers.\n",
      "• The actor George Clooney and his wife, Amal, said Tuesday that they would donate $500,000 to a nationwide protest against gun violence planned for next month by the Stoneman Douglas High students. The announcement inspired similar gifts from other big-name Hollywood figures, including the producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife, Marilyn, Oprah Winfrey, and Steven Spielberg and his wife, Kate Capshaw.\n",
      "• As of Monday, two survivors of the shooting remained hospitalized in fair condition at Broward Health North, and two others remained in fair condition at Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale.\n",
      "• The Florida shooting has renewed attention on state laws that allow a judge to take away weapons from people who are deemed dangerous, known as “red flag” laws. Some governors have shown a willingness to change their mind on gun restrictions, but other simply dug in on their stances.\n",
      "• In Florida, an AR-15 is easier to buy than a handgun. Read more on how the AR-15 became one of the weapons of choice for mass killers, and the research that tries to explain the high rate of mass shootings in the United States.\n",

      "State Representative Kionne McGhee, a Democrat from Miami, asked for an unusual procedural move to consider his legislation, which had been filed earlier in the session but was never scheduled for a hearing.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“The shooting in Parkland demands extraordinary action,” Mr. McGhee said Tuesday on the House floor, as a different group of Stoneman Douglas High students, who had previously arrived, peered down from the gallery.\n",
      "The motion failed, 36 to 71, in a vote along party lines. At least one student burst into tears, Mr. McGhee said. One girl covered her mouth in despair, as a woman patted her arm to comfort her. The episode lasted 2 minutes and 38 seconds.\n",
      "As the news began to spread aboard a bus of students headed to the capital, Anthony Lopez, 16, a junior, slammed his head back on the bus seat. He placed a hand on his forehead. “That’s infuriating,” he said. “They’re acting inhuman.”\n",
      "“The one fear we have is that nothing will change,” he added.\n",
      "A similar proposal filed last year in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando also went nowhere.\n",
      "Republican leaders in the Legislature have said they would consider more modest proposals, including raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles, before the session ends in March. The Miami Herald reported that legislators in both the Florida House and Senate were also drafting legislation to limit access to semiautomatic rifles, after years of reluctance. That plan would bar people under 21 from possession of an assault rifle, and would require buyers to wait three days before purchasing any kind of rifle.\n",
      "“The House looks forward to working with the Governor and Senate to find solutions to fulfill government’s primary mission — to keep its citizens — its children safe,” said Richard Corcoran, the Republican speaker of the House, in a statement. “And it is our goal to give these collective solutions the serious review and consideration they deserve.”\n",
      "In session later on Tuesday, the House did approve a resolution declaring pornography a public health risk. Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, questioned why the pornography proposal was given priority. Implicit in his question was why the assault weapons ban was not.\n",
      "“Has anyone ever been killed as a result of the health implications of pornography?” he asked.\n",

      "            I will be on the bus today with teenage activists from Stoneman Douglas who are driving 7 hours to rally for gun law reform in Tallahassee. Please follow here and @nytimes for live updates. pic.twitter.com/AxaABSdHKl \n",
      "Buoyed by viral tweets and media interviews, several Stoneman Douglas High students who survived the attack have been vocal about wanting change since the shooting. Their message: We’ve been there. Listen to us.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "At first, the students gained notice for their raw, emotional reactions in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The emotion hasn’t receded, but efforts to channel their grief into legislative change — like 18-year-old Emma González’s appeal for gun laws — have been widely praised.\n",
      "Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control.\n",
      "On Tuesday, teenagers from the school, gripping pillows and sleeping bags and carrying doughnuts and candy, packed a grocery store parking lot in Coral Springs, Fla., to begin the more than 400-mile journey to Tallahassee.\n",
      "Their goal: convincing lawmakers to pass a slate of gun control bills in a state that has been among the friendliest to firearm owners in the nation.\n",
      "Many had come straight from the funeral of one of the dead. They hugged their parents goodbye and loaded backpacks into the bellies of three buses. Dozens climbed aboard.\n",
      "In a telephone interview from the bus, Sarah Chadwick, 16, a junior, said the social media response to the students had been overwhelming, but she wanted everyone to know: “We see your support, we see what you’re doing.”\n",
      "The students felt they had the “best voices to listen to right now,” along with other survivors of shootings, and that Twitter had allowed them to reach more people than they would have thought possible, she said.\n",
      "“We have stuff to say, and we won’t be silenced after a matter of days, or even weeks,” she said.\n",

      "But as they strategized in the back of the bus, some worried that Mr. Clooney’s star power and liberal activism would swallow their voices and push conservatives away.\n",
      "“The minute they don’t see our faces anymore, and they just see the Hollywood elite, they’re going to stop taking it seriously,” said Chris Grady, 18, a senior with a mop of curly hair.\n",
      "Mr. Grady said he had enlisted in the Army a few months back, but that the attack at his school had made him think hard about whether that was the path he wanted to take.\n",
      "“As it stands right now, the real danger is at home, not abroad,” he said. “So this is where I want to be — right at the heart of the movement.”\n",
      "“I wasn’t sure what I wanted to study,” he continued. “And now for sure I’ll be getting my degree in political science.”\n",
      "Finally, around 10 p.m., the three buses of students from Stoneman Douglas High rolled into the parking lot of a Tallahassee high school. They had arrived.\n",
      "One hundred Marjory Stoneman Douglas students traveled to Tallahassee to advocate for gun control. Survivors spoke to legislators while supporters protested across the country.\n",
      "“Oh. My. God,” said one teenager, peering out the bus window. “It’s so many people.”\n",
      "A crowd of people from Leon High had gathered in front of the red brick building to support and cheer the Stoneman Douglas group.\n",
      "In the morning, the students will break into groups and meet with some 70 elected officials. Gov. Rick Scott is expected to give them two hours.\n",

      "Mallory Muller, a Stoneman Douglas High student, hugged a teddy bear to her chest.\n",
      "“The whole bus ride here I was very anxious,” she said. “You have the nervousness about — what happens? And kind of scared for your own safety.”\n",
      "“We know what we’re doing tomorrow is big,” she went on, “so I think there is that buildup tomorrow, too. That pressure.”\n",
      "Before marching south toward Stoneman Douglas High, dozens of students from West Boca Raton High School first gathered in the courtyard of their school for a peaceful protest — 17 minutes of silence for the 17 victims — but then someone opened a door and walked out, and others followed, a videotape of the scene aired by WPTV showed.\n",
      "“Everybody started walking,” one student told the news channel. “It felt like half the school was walking.”\n",
      "As the students walked south on U.S. Highway 441, sheriff’s deputies lined the road to direct traffic and keep them safe, but did not interfere. The distance between the two schools is about 10 miles.\n",
      "The march from Boca Raton surprised Broward County officials, who said they had heard nothing about the protest. Todd DeAngelis, a spokesman for the city of Parkland, said the authorities abruptly assembled an escort by law enforcement and organized water stations on a day when the temperature was in the low 80s.\n",
      "In a rare honor, the United States Military Academy offered the member, Peter Wang, 15, the realization of a lifelong dream: admission to West Point, posthumously. The academy said it was extending the offer in recognition of his “heroic actions” during the shooting.\n",
      "Mr. Wang was last seen holding a door open at Stoneman Douglas High so that others could escape, Ernie Rospierski, a teacher who survived, told CBS News.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Relatives of Mr. Wang, a cadet in the school’s Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, described him as modest and not interested in status, but eager to serve and help others.\n",
      "At his funeral on Tuesday, the military mourners acknowledged him as one of them. They came in echoes of the uniform that he had once proudly worn: Marine and Navy dress blues, high school R.O.T.C. members in their dress uniforms, others wearing camouflage fatigues. Veterans were in attendance, as well.\n",
      "“We came down to represent,” said Jeff Colopy, vice commander of American Legion Post 157 in Margate, Fla., to “pay tribute to one of our fallen comrades. In our eyes, he was military.”\n",
      "Lying in an open coffin in the small chapel at Kraeer Funeral Home and Cremation Center in Coral Springs, with a military honor guard at either end, Mr. Wang wore his uniform. A line of mourners stretched out of the chapel, with scores more waiting under a tent outside.\n",
      "Mr. Wang was one of three Junior R.O.T.C. cadets who were killed in the shooting; the others were Martin Duque, 14, and Alaina Petty, also 14.\n",
      "The shooting suspect, Mr. Cruz, had also been a member of his school’s Army Junior R.O.T.C., and had “excelled” in air rifle marksmanship contests with other schools in the area in a program that was supported by a grant from the National Rifle Association Foundation, according to The Associated Press. He was wearing his maroon Junior R.O.T.C. emblem polo shirt when he was arrested after the shooting, The A.P. reported.\n",
      "“We all have those shirts,” Angelyse Perez, an 18-year-old senior and a company commander, told The Washington Post. “We’re never wearing them again. We’re going to destroy them all.”\n",
      "At rallies across the country on Monday and Tuesday, students made pleas for gun control and declared that while they might not be old enough to vote, they were old enough to change society.\n",

      "In Battle Creek, Mich., dozens of students walked out of Harper Creek High School on Tuesday to protest gun violence in schools.\n",
      "And in Bakersfield, Calif., about a dozen students and 80 adults joined a protest on Monday. “Listening to how worried my mother was dropping me off Friday morning after the shooting was one of the worst things I’ve had to listen to in a while,” Lucy Brown, a member of the Bakersfield High School Young Democrats Club who helped organize the protests, told bakersfield.com.\n",
      "The Florida shooting has renewed attention on state laws that allow a judge to remove weapons from people deemed dangerous, known as “red flag” laws. The measures are frequently supported by Democrats, but opposed by many Republicans and gun rights advocates.\n",
      "State Representative Arthur O’Neill, a Republican from Connecticut, one of only five states to have such laws, has said he would write to legislative leaders in other states to urge them to adopt similar laws. “Unfortunately, this law is not as widely known as it should be,” Mr. O’Neill said last week in a statement.\n",

      "Advertisement\n",
      "Similar bills have been proposed this year in other states, including Hawaii and Illinois. The N.R.A. has often spoken against red flag legislation, saying the judges’ orders can infringe on a person’s Second Amendment rights when no crime has been committed.\n",
      "In Vermont, a progressive but rural state with largely permissive gun laws, Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, initially told reporters the state’s gun laws did not need to be updated after the Florida shooting, according to news reports. But Mr. Scott changed his tone a day later, after the authorities accused an 18-year-old student of planning an attack at his school in Fair Haven, Vt.\n",
      "“We must determine if we are truly doing all we can to prevent violence,” Mr. Scott said, and asked legislative leaders to identify policy changes and have “an open conversation about gun safety.”\n",

      "“Would you feel as though your Second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn’t buy a God darn AR-15?” Mr. Kasich, who voted for an assault weapons ban in 1994 while in Congress, asked on CNN. “These are the things that have to be looked at.”\n",
      "In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, repeated a position he took in late January after a 15-year-old shot and killed two fellow students at a high school in Benton, Ky.

      "A day earlier, Mr. Trump had supported expanding background checks to purchases at gun shows and on the internet, a measure that conservatives vowed would not become law.\n",

      "• President Vladimir Putin announced a new generation of nuclear weapons on Thursday, including what he described as an “invincible” missile and a nuclear torpedo that could outsmart American defenses.\n",
      "His announcement, during his annual state of the nation address, focused on a vulnerability of American-designed defenses: They are based on the assumption that missiles fly high and can be destroyed well before they reach their targets.\n",
      "But the new Russian weapons, Mr. Putin said, travel low and too fast for defenders to react.\n",
      "• Some experts suggested that Mr. Putin was bluffing, and American officials said that the nuclear cruise missile was not yet operational.\n",

      "Under the proposed “right-to-disconnect” bill, private companies with more than 10 employees would be banned from requiring their workers to respond to electronic work communications (email, text and others) after work hours.\n",

And that’s not including hours spent emailing at home. A 2017 study found that, on average, workers spend an extra eight hours a week sending email after work.\n",
      "Research has also shown that people who responded to work communications after 9 p.m. had a worse quality of sleep and were less engaged the next day.\n",
      "“When you don’t have recovery and time off, it leads to more stress and ultimately burnout and exhaustion,” said Larissa K.

      "\n",
      "OAK CREEK, Wis. — The worshipers, hundreds of them, had gathered Sunday for the afternoon meal in the vast, bright dining hall at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, just as they do every Sunday.\n",
      "But before long, the happy din of the congregants was interrupted by a grim bulletin from Texas. People pushed away their plates of cauliflower and rice as the horrific news chirped across their cellphones. A gunman in a house of God. Multiple fatalities. Multiple injuries.\n",
      "The Sikh temple was 1,300 miles and worlds away from the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex. But at the temple, where a mass shooting left six dead five years ago, it felt sickeningly familiar, as it had at congregations in South Carolina and Tennessee and New York, places on the grim list of religious congregations that have become victims of gun violence. As different as they are, they share both a tragic past and a continuing struggle to move beyond it.\n",
      "“Every time this happens, we feel the pain again,” said Harjinder Singh, a priest, as he sat in the quiet temple on Tuesday. “It is like when you have a bandage on your body, and it is ripped away.”\n",
      "In a nation awash in guns, houses of worship in recent years have been the setting for numerous fatal shootings, including an attack by a white supremacist in 2015 at a historically African-American church in Charleston, S.C., that left nine people dead.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "As the news of Sunday’s massacre sunk in, there was a queasy feeling of solidarity in these sacred but violated spaces. Their leaders knew that the members of the First Baptist Church would soon be forced to partake in new rituals, and ask new questions about maintaining both security and a welcoming spirit.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "They knew that the answers could not be perfect. And they knew that the Texans would feel the violation in their bones.\n",
      "“Church may be one of our last places of refuge. Now it’s as if that is even being challenged,” said Joey Spann, the pastor of Burnette Chapel Church of Christ near Nashville, on Tuesday. Mr. Spann was shot in the hand and chest on Sept. 24. That Sunday, a 25-year-old former congregant waited in the parking lot for people to leave the morning service then opened fire, killing a mother of two and injuring seven others.\n",
      "Such violence, Mr. Spann said, “won’t overcome the church, the Bible promises us that. But it seems like even that place of refuge is being taken from us.”\n",
      "Violent attacks at houses of worship are not new. White Southerners opposed to racial integration bombed a number of African-American churches in the Deep South in the 1950s and ’60s. Most infamous was the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, which killed four young girls.\n",
      "But violence has escalated in recent years. The suspect in the attack at Mr. Spann’s church in Nashville, who as a child came here as a refugee from Sudan, left a note in his car referring to Dylann S. Roof, the white man who killed nine black people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n",
      "In the five years since the attack on the Sikh temple, by an Army veteran with ties to white supremacist groups, its worshipers have done their best to move forward. They forgave the assailant, Wade M. Page, “that very day,” Mr. Singh said. They have strengthened their bonds with members of the community, a mostly white, working-class town of 36,000 along the shore of Lake Michigan.\n",
      "Willi Glee, 77, a member of Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, believes that for some attackers, religious spaces offer an added attraction, because defiling them is the ultimate taboo.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“The killer thinks he gets the most dramatic effect from that,” Mr. Glee said. “Because everybody expects that a house of worship is a safe place.”\n",
      "At Emanuel A.M.E. Church, a bedrock of black Charleston that was founded in 1791, doors once left open are now locked. Visitors are allowed in after they announce their presence over an intercom system. Strangers’ bags are checked before services. A cast of retired military and on- and off-duty police officers remain vigilant.\n",
      "Something similar happened at the Al-Furqan Jame Masjid, a mosque in Queens, N.Y. A little more than a year ago, the imam, Alauddin Akonjee, 55, and his assistant, Thara Miah, 64, were shot dead after leaving afternoon prayers on a busy street close to the mosque.\n",
      "A suspect, Oscar Morel, was later brought into custody, before pleading not guilty to murder charges. Since the shooting, surveillance cameras have been set up around the mosque’s perimeter, and the local police precinct has been made aware of prayer times. Inside, vigilance is encouraged.\n",
      "“We tell the people: ‘When you come inside, turn right and turn left,’” said Bazlur Rahman, 51, an official of the mosque, after afternoon prayers on Tuesday. “‘If you see someone suspicious — someone who is unknown to the community — tell us.’”\n",
      "Inside the Sikh temple, there is another struggle. Family members of the people who were killed still come to worship, despite the lingering trauma. Of the nearly 500 people at the Sikh temple who regularly arrive for Sunday services, many still worry that they are vulnerable to another attack.\n",
      "“If it happens one time, people are afraid that it will happen again,” Mr. Singh said.\n",
      "In Charleston, the fear also lingers. In court testimony in January, Felicia Sanders, who witnessed the massacre there, described in aching terms how the shooting had haunted her.\n",

      "“I can’t hear something as small as an acorn drop from out of a tree,” Ms. Sanders, the mother of one of the victims, said during the sentencing hearing for Mr. Roof, the gunman. “Most importantly, I cannot shut my eye to pray. I cannot shut my eye to pray. Even when I try, I cannot because I have to keep my eye on everyone that is around me. That is a sad day.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "There have also been good days — and stories of adaptation, transformation, healing and hope. Emanuel A.M.E. has become a site of pilgrimage for people around the world, including white Americans seeking communion with and forgiveness from their black neighbors.\n",
      "At St. Peters Missionary Baptist Church in Dayton, Ohio, the Rev. William B. Schooler was fatally shot by his brother in February 2016 during a service. On Tuesday, Alberta Blayth, the church secretary, said that the incident had bound the congregants more tightly. “We are closer,” she said. “Let’s keep praying these things stop.”\n",
      "In Tennessee, Mr. Spann said that his little church has in many ways been rejuvenated since the shooting. Sunday morning is now a celebration, a gathering of people who understand each other.\n",
      "“A lot of good has come out of this,” he said. “The church is tighter, expresses love easier.”\n",
      "He acknowledged the differences between what happened at Burnette Chapel and in Sutherland Springs. The sheer scale of death at the church in Texas, the murder of so many children and the smallness of the community will make it harder for them, and will perhaps be a stronger test of faith.\n",
      "But both congregations have learned firsthand that there is darkness in the world, as much as people may want to deny it.\n",
      "“It’s always going to be in front of you,” he said, referring to the memory of such shootings. “It’s always going to be discussed, it’s always going to be on your mind. But so will God’s grace and God’s mercy and God’s strength.”\n",

      "Re “The Gun Carnage, as Time Goes By” (editorial, Oct. 13):\n",
      "The growing inability of the Republican congressional leadership to meet its basic constitutional obligations is further shown by Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s call for a regulatory solution to the bump-stock loophole.\n",
      "Unlike legislation, a regulatory change is impermanent, subject to the whims of our commander in chief. Further, it would provide no funding mechanism to address the additional costs the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms would incur from its expanded regulatory role.\n",
      "The bureau is already overextended, and the speaker’s proposal would stretch the bureau even further beyond capacity. (For the record, so, too, would a Republican amendment to the House-passed fiscal year 2018 appropriations package that diverts bureau funding from important criminal investigations to reviews of applications by people seeking restoration of gun privileges.)\n",
      "Republicans control Congress and the White House; nothing is stopping them from banning bump-stock devices except their own unwillingness to vote on any gun-violence-prevention legislation.\n",
      "Speaker Ryan and his leadership team need to stop passing the buck and secure a legislative fix to this loophole along with additional meaningful legislation. Democrats are on board. Plus, couldn’t Republicans use a victory?\n",

      "Both sides of the gun control debate saw this week’s decisions by Dick’s Sporting Goods, Walmart and Kroger to limit firearms sales as symbolically game-changing.\n",
      "But whether those changes will actually have a meaningful effect on gun sales is difficult — if not impossible — to know.\n",
      "In an era when the toy industry can pinpoint the overall value of all dolls sold domestically each year and the federal government tracks the number of trucks sold in any given month, data on gun sales is obscured by foggy reporting standards and loopholes. There is no nationwide registry that tracks gun ownership while firearms are available to purchase from a decentralized network of retailers, shows and individuals that operate publicly, privately, online and offline.\n",
      "Many trade groups can offer granular detail on the products their members manufacture, but the gun industry is much less forthcoming. Only a handful of gunmakers are publicly owned and required to provide some sales information.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Efforts to require a nationwide registry have also faced resistance over concerns about potential threats to Second Amendment rights — a central repository of data could eventually lead to firearms being confiscated by the government, critics have said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Some researchers have blamed the National Rifle Association, the firearms industry’s powerful lobbying group, for blocking the government’s ability to study guns and gun crimes. For example, a 1996 provision known as the Dickey Amendment effectively barred the Centers for Disease Control from tapping taxpayer funds set aside for injury prevention and control for research that could be used for gun control advocacy. For years, the stipulation severely chilled the C.D.C.’s activity in the field — even after 2013, when President Barack Obama ordered the agency to look into causes of gun violence and strategies to end it.\n",
      "Gun control advocates believe that the lack of information is a way for the firearms lobby to skirt accountability for gun-related crime.\n",
      "“The tracking of information in this industry is just not granular enough to be useful for policy discussions,” said David Chipman, a senior policy adviser at Giffords, a gun safety advocacy organization. “Tracking a gun is harder than tracking a package — you know at a high level how many firearms are manufactured, but you don’t know where they went from there.”\n",
      "The end result is an industry that sees its numbers recorded only in broad strokes, and fewer of those strokes in each step of the way from manufacturer to retailer to buyer to second owner.\n",
      "American gun manufacturers produce millions of firearms annually — nearly 9.4 million in 2015, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Nearly 3.7 million of those were rifles, including  AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles like those used in several mass shootings.\n",
      "Only a few of the thousands of licensed firearms manufacturers in the country are publicly owned and must disclose sales figures to investors. Those include American Outdoor Brands Corporation, formerly known as Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation, which has reported declines in firearms sales for the past four quarters but generally does not report specific volumes. On Thursday, the company said that revenue from its firearms segment for the third quarter slumped 40.6 percent from last year to $117.6 million, compared with a 13.4 percent upswing in its outdoor products division.\n",
      "Sturm Ruger, another public company, cut its production levels by 24 percent last year and also laid off 28 percent of its employees, according to Wedbush analysts. Other investor-owned businesses include Vista Outdoor and Olin, which both make ammunition.\n",

      "A slew of smaller, single-product manufacturers emerged during the Obama administration, experts said. Most make semiautomatic firearms like the AR-15 known by some as assault weapons and by others as modern sport rifles. Few, if any, are eager to share performance metrics with the public.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "And few gun dealers publicly disclose how many guns they sell. The N.R.A. did not respond to requests for information about sales.\n",
      "Analysts estimate that fewer than a quarter of firearms sales to consumers come from big-box retailers like Walmart and the outdoor and hunting outfitter Cabela’s. At Dick’s Sporting Goods, revenue from hunting products, including rifles, constitute 10 percent or less of annual sales, according to another Wedbush report.\n",
      "Although Dick’s stores can be found nationwide, it sold assault-style rifles only at its 35 Field & Stream stores and on its websites. Walmart, which had already instituted similar restrictions in 2015, sells firearms at about half of its nearly 4,000 supercenter locations nationwide.\n",
      "Mom-and-pop shops make up a sizable percentage of the 56,000 federally licensed firearms dealers that the A.T.F. said were in business late last year.\n",
      "Gun and ammunition stores in the United States did $8.6 billion in business in 2016, not including sales from sporting goods and outdoor stores, online retailers, gun show vendors and pawn shops, according to a report from IBISWorld. But shops are not required to regularly share inventory accounts, meaning it is unclear how much of that business is made up of assault-style rifles like those that Dick’s stopped selling.\n",
      "There is a way to get a partial picture of retail gun sales from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which was established by the F.B.I. in 1998. But that system, too, lacks detailed data.\n",
      "Federally licensed dealers cannot sell firearms without running a background check of the prospective buyer. But the due diligence process, which is conducted via phone or computer and usually completed within minutes, likely underestimates the true volume of gun sales. Requests for a background check do not disclose how many guns are being purchased in that transaction.\n",
      "Licensed gun dealers are frequent fixtures at the thousands of gun shows that take place across the country each year, but private sellers, who are not required to run background checks on buyers, also attend the events. They often advertise personal firearms on signs strung around their necks, taped to gun cases or attached to rifles slung over their shoulders.\n",
      "This so-called gun show loophole, which also applies to mail-order purchases and other transactions, allows firearms deals between individuals in the same state to go essentially unmonitored.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Research into such sales is limited. One A.T.F. study, from 1999, estimated that 25 percent to 50 percent of gun-show vendors were unlicensed. A study last year found that 22 percent of gun owners who recently acquired firearms had done so without a background check.\n",

      "\n",
      "ALBANY  — It was, especially in a restrictive state like New York, a seemingly modest set of gun-control proposals.\n",
      "Prospective gun buyers would undergo longer background checks; an institute would be formed to study gun violence; courts would be allowed to seize or prohibit the sale of guns to potentially violent individuals; and a ban would be enacted on the possession of bump stocks, which can make a semiautomatic rifle shoot nearly as fast as a fully automatic version.\n",
      "And yet, the legislative proposals have not been embraced by the Republican-controlled State Senate.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers tried a different parliamentary gambit: They attached the gun-control proposals to an existing bill, a move known as a hostile amendment, trying to force the Republican leadership to formally vote them down in an election year.\n",
      "Across the nation, the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida has seemingly pushed the needle on gun control; even President Trump, a guns-rights advocate, now says he wants to ban bump stocks and favors tighter background checks.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But in New York, the needle was unmoved. Each Republican senator, along with a single rogue Democrat, refused to take it up on Wednesday.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“They have apparently followed the lead of their allies in Washington who are unable to do anything when it comes to sensible gun control,” said Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who leads a group of nearly two dozen Democrats in Albany’s upper chamber. “I was hoping that New York, would be, at least, an example.”\n",
      "The vote was by no means assured, given the dynamics of the Senate, where the Republicans hold control through their collaboration with nine renegade Democratic senators, eight of whom comprise the Independent Democratic Conference.\n",
      "The Democratic maneuver began with Ms. Stewart-Cousins’s deputy, Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, trying to get the amendments considered and calling for the Senate to act.\n",
      "“We have to cross a line in our thinking, not only in this state but in the country,” Mr. Gianaris said, adding that it was “mind-boggling to me that we could watch our children die and we’re sitting here making excuses.”\n",
      "Twenty-nine Democrats, including all eight members of the Independent Democratic Conference, voted to consider the amendments, falling short of the 32 needed for passage. Mr. Gianaris failed to persuade a single Republican to consider the measure; more important, he also failed to lure Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat, to his side.\n",
      "Mr. Felder said that he felt the bills were being rushed to the floor in piecemeal fashion.\n",
      "“I do believe that its better to do something that’s as important as this in a very comprehensive way,” said Mr. Felder, who has sponsored a bill to put armed guards at schools, something he says he wished would have been taken up sooner.\n",
      "“I think ‘now’ is a very broad term,” he continued, adding, “There’s a balance between doing something expeditiously or doing something immediately that’s not really conclusive, not comprehensive.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The Independent Democratic Conference and Ms. Stewart-Cousins’ group of mainstream Democrats have tentatively pledged to form a new majority in April, after two special elections to fill seats vacated by Democrats. (That plan still depends on Mr. Felder, who has repeatedly said he is loyal to no party.)\n",
      "“Those who stand on the wrong side of history on this issue will be judged harshly,” Mr. Gianaris said. “Starting with this election.”\n",

      "Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, questioned Mr. Gianaris’s foresight. “Every two years Senator Gianaris predicts our demise and he’s been wrong every single time,” he said. “We’re going to win in November because we’re actually delivering on the issues that middle-class families care about: affordability, opportunity, and yes, security.”\n",
      "Just before the push for a vote, the Republican leader of the Senate, John J. Flanagan of Long Island, issued a statement, suggesting a variety of measures aimed at increasing school safety, including more funding for security cameras, armed guards at schools, panic buttons, “hardening of school doors,” and “a much stronger response to the mental health issues at the heart of much of this violence.”\n",
      "“Every responsible option is on the table, and wherever we think we can make a difference, we will act,” Mr. Flanagan said, saying the Senate could consider new legislation by next week.\n",
      "“Schools must be safe havens, where students can learn and teachers can teach. In New York, they will be,” he said. Mr. Flanagan’s statement did not mention the word “guns.”\n",
      "Mr. Cuomo, who pushed through a broad package of gun control measures known as the SAFE Act in 2013 after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., offered measured support for the Senate Democrats’ attempt. The 2013 law banned the sale of assault rifles and required registration of such rifles already owned at the time of its passage.\n",
      "“While we need to review the specific legislation, these are all concepts we support as ways to strengthen the strongest gun safety laws in the nation,” said Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor.\n",
      "The governor, a second-term Democrat seeking re-election in the fall, had been more forceful earlier Wednesday on a conference call with reporters, criticizing Republicans in Washington and other states for their “incremental” approach to gun control, including raising the age for buying some weapons, calling it “reprehensible political pandering.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But he also conceded that “a state law cannot solve this problem,” and called on his fellow Democrats in Washington to “put a real gun bill on the table,” including new background checks, a mental health database, and a ban on military-style assault weapons, like the one used at Marjory Stoneman Douglas.\n",
      "Mr. Cuomo also openly mocked ideas like arming teachers or placing more security officers at schools.\n",
      "“That worked phenomenally well in Florida, right?” said Mr. Cuomo, apparently referencing a Broward County sheriff’s deputy who did not enter the high school after the shooting started, and saying he was bewildered by the idea of “shootouts in classrooms.”\n",
      "“It’s an N.R.A. answer,” he said. “Their answer is always the same: more guns.”\n",
      "Ms. Stewart-Cousins seemed disheartened by the lack of action on Wednesday.\n",
      "“To just do nothing, to continue to do nothing, day after day, week after week, year after year, in the face of things that we really all know are terrible tragedies, that we can do something about,” Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. “It’s just really unacceptable.”\n",

      "By MICHAEL D. SHEARFEB. 28, 2018\n",
      "\n",
      "In a meeting with lawmakers, President Trump expressed support for a “comprehensive” gun bill that would include stronger background checks and temporarily take guns away from high-risk individuals.\n",
      "WASHINGTON — President Trump stunned Republicans on live television Wednesday by embracing gun control and urging a group of lawmakers at the White House to resurrect gun safety legislation that has been opposed for years by the powerful National Rifle Association and the vast majority of his party.\n",
      "In a remarkable meeting, the president veered wildly from the N.R.A. playbook in front of giddy Democrats and stone-faced Republicans. He called for comprehensive gun control legislation that would expand background checks to weapons purchased at gun shows and on the internet, keep guns from mentally ill people, secure schools and restrict gun sales for some young adults. He even suggested a conversation on an assault weapons ban.\n",
      "At one point, Mr. Trump suggested that law enforcement authorities should have the power to seize guns from mentally ill people or others who could present a danger without first going to court. “I like taking the guns early,” he said, adding, “Take the guns first, go through due process second.”\n",
      "The declarations prompted a frantic series of calls from N.R.A. lobbyists to their allies on Capitol Hill and a statement from the group calling the ideas that Mr. Trump expressed “bad policy.” Republican lawmakers suggested to reporters that they remained opposed to gun control measures.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“We’re not ditching any constitutional protections simply because the last person the president talked to today doesn’t like them,” Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said in a statement.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Democrats, too, said they were skeptical that Mr. Trump would follow through.\n",
      "“The White House can now launch a lobbying campaign to get universal background checks passed, as the president promised in this meeting, or they can sit and do nothing,” said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut.\n",
      "At the core of Mr. Trump’s suggestion was the revival of a bipartisan bill drafted in 2013 by Senators Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Despite a concerted push by President Barack Obama and the personal appeals of Sandy Hook parents, the bill fell to a largely Republican filibuster.\n",
      "Polls show solid support for stricter laws, especially after mass shootings. But there is also deep disagreement, staunch opposition and growing disenchantment with gun control.\n",
      "Mr. Trump’s embrace did not immediately yield converts. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said after the meeting that he was unmoved, repeating the Republican dogma that recent shootings were not “conducted by someone who bought a gun at a gun show or parking lot.” Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, who sat next to the president looking flustered, emerged from the meeting and declared, “I thought it was fascinating television and it was surreal to actually be there.”\n",
      "But Mr. Trump suggested that the dynamics in Washington had changed after the  school shooting in Florida that claimed 17 lives, in part because of his own leadership in the White House, a sentiment that the Democrats in the room readily appeared to embrace as they saw the president supporting their ideas.\n",
      "“It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everyone could support,” Mr. Trump said as Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and a longtime advocate of gun control, sat smiling to his left. “It’s time that a president stepped up.”\n",
      "Democrats tried to turn sometimes muddled presidential musings into firm policy: “You saw the president clearly saying not once, not twice, not three times, but like 10 times, that he wanted to see a strong universal background check bill,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. “He didn’t mince words about it. So I do not understand how then he could back away from that.”\n",
      "Just what the performance means, and whether Mr. Trump will aggressively push for new gun restrictions, remain uncertain given his history of taking erratic positions on policy issues, especially ones that have long polarized Washington and the country.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The gun control performance on Wednesday was reminiscent of a similar televised discussion with lawmakers about immigration in January during which the president appeared to back bipartisan legislation to help young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children — only to reverse himself and push a hard-line approach that helped scuttle consensus in the Senate.\n",
      "Mr. Trump’s comments during the hourlong meeting were at odds with his history as a candidate and president who has repeatedly declared his love for the Second Amendment and the N.R.A., which gave his campaign $30 million. At the group’s annual conference last year, Mr. Trump declared, “To the N.R.A., I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "                When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.            \n",
      "But at the meeting, the president repeatedly rejected the N.R.A.’s top legislative priority, a bill known as concealed-carry reciprocity, which would allow a person with permission to carry a concealed weapon in one state to automatically do so in every state. To the dismay of Republicans, he dismissed the measure as having no chance at passage in the Congress. Republican leaders in the House had paired that N.R.A. priority with a modest measure to improve data reporting to the existing instant background check system.\n",
      "“You’ll never get it,” Mr. Trump told Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House Republican whip who was gravely injured in a mass shooting last year but still opposes gun restrictions. “You’ll never get it passed. We want to get something done.”\n",
      "Mr. Trump also flatly insisted that legislation should raise the minimum age for buying rifles to 21 from 18 — an idea the N.R.A. and many Republicans fiercely oppose. When Mr. Toomey pushed back on an increase in the minimum age for rifles, the president accused him of fearing the N.R.A. — a remarkable slap since the association withdrew its support for Mr. Toomey over his background check bill.\n",
      "“If there’s a Republican who’s demonstrated he’s not afraid of the N.R.A., that would be me,” Mr. Toomey said after the meeting.\n",
      "The president appeared eager to challenge the impression that he is bought and paid for by the gun rights group. While calling the membership of the N.R.A. “well meaning,” he also said he told its leaders at a lunch on Sunday that “it’s time. We’re going to stop this nonsense. It’s time.”\n",
      "Officials at the gun group were taken aback by the president’s comments and immediately ramped up their lobbying against measures that they have long said would damage the Second Amendment and do little to protect people against gun violence.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“While today’s meeting made for great TV, the gun control policies discussed would make bad policy that wouldn’t keep our children safer,” said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A.’s lobbying arm. “We are going to continue to work to pass policies that might actually prevent another horrific tragedy.”\n",

      "But at least for Wednesday, Mr. Trump seemed willing to venture far from the N.R.A. script, even appearing to suggest that he might back a ban on assault-style weapons when Ms. Feinstein asked what they could do about “weapons of war.” The N.R.A. has helped defeat an assault weapons ban since the last one expired in 2004.\n",
      "The reaction in Washington was swift. Breitbart.com, a right-wing site once led by Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s onetime chief strategist, published an article with a headline in bright red that said, “TRUMP THE GUN GRABBER.”\n",
      "The site added that the president “Cedes Dems’ Wish List — Bump Stocks, Buying Age, ‘Assault Weapons,’ Background Checks. Tells Scalise to Take a Hike — After Surviving Assassination Attempt.”\n",
      "The president did return several times to a proposal that conservatives like: arming teachers in schools and ending the so-called gun-free zones around schools that Mr. Trump said had made those institutions among the most vulnerable targets for mass shooters.\n",
      "“You’ve got to have defense, too,” the president told the lawmakers. “You can’t just be sitting ducks. And that’s exactly what we’ve allowed people in these buildings and schools to be.”\n",
      "But several times, he acknowledged how controversial that proposal was, and seemed to accept the idea that it might not be included in a comprehensive gun control measure that could pass both chambers of Congress.\n",
      "He also backed a modest measure sponsored by a Republican and a Democrat in the Senate to improve the quality of the data in the background check system. But he told the bill’s author, Mr. Cornyn, to consider just adding that proposal to the broader expansion of the background check system.\n",
      "“It would be nice to add everything on to it,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe change the title. Maybe we could make it much more comprehensive and have one bill.”\n",

      "DAVOS, Switzerland — President Trump didn’t say how delighted he was to be in Sweden, he didn’t call any countries s-holes, he didn’t threaten to “totally destroy” another nation, and he didn’t brag that his “nuclear button” was “much bigger” than anyone else’s. In other words, Trump’s speech here at the World Economic Forum was a resounding success.\n",
      "O.K., fact-checkers found at least two falsehoods, and the audience booed when Trump went off script and raged at “how nasty, how mean, how vicious and how fake the press can be.” Yet on the whole, he read an anodyne speech perfectly well off the teleprompter, making it a personal triumph for him — albeit also probably the weakest speech delivered by any leader in Davos this year.\n",
      "The past week has underscored how much the world needs American leadership, and how badly Trump is falling short — or, more precisely, when he provides leadership, it’s often in the wrong direction, setting us back.\n",
      "The upshot is that there’s now a global vacuum of practical and moral leadership.\n",
      "There are challenges from North Korea to Yemen, from climate to refugees, plus atrocities in Myanmar that probably amount to genocide. South Sudan is collapsing, and in Syria, 16 bombings of hospitals or clinics have been reported just since Christmas — and barely an eyebrow has been raised.\n",
      "Trump is a gift to the world’s tyrants in two important ways. First, he doesn’t typically stand up to them. Second, his tweets and outrages suck the oxygen from other important issues worldwide. (It’s fair to criticize us in the news media as well. Too often we’re like dogs yapping at everything that moves, distracted by the latest shiny Trumpian thing.)\n",
      "Evan Osnos of The New Yorker captured Trump’s “leadership” style: “Barack Obama’s foreign policy was characterized as leading from behind. Trump’s doctrine may come to be understood as retreating from the front.”\n",
      "With the U.S. in retreat, there’s no one who can fill the gap.\n",
      "Angela Merkel, who in Davos called right-wing populism a “poison” and warned against erecting walls, is struggling in Germany to form a coalition government. Prime Minister Theresa May is a hobbled leader of a diminished Britain. Xi Jinping brutalized the only Nobel Peace Prize laureate China has ever had. India is unhelpful even with the Myanmar crisis in its neighborhood. Brazil and South Africa are in political chaos. And Vladimir Putin is too busy interfering with elections outside Russia or stealing bits of Ukraine to lead anything.\n",
      "Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, gave a powerful speech in Davos challenging attendees to promote women and address pay inequity, family planning and child care to help women flourish. But Trudeau can be more of a talker than a doer; he has been less generous with foreign aid than his predecessor.\n",
      "So Trump is all there is. Alas, he’s not in the business of solving global problems, but of creating them.\n",
      "We’ve seen that in his threats to annihilate North Korea, his pullback from trade agreements and the Paris climate accord, and his threats to the Iran nuclear deal. He promised Middle East peace but has made the situation worse.\n",
      "Does he inspire allies? Well, Germany’s conservative newspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, asked in a headline this month: “Is Trump Still Sane?”\n",
      "It’s not quite right to say that Trump is providing no leadership. Trump is “protecting” us from refugees, but not from Russian manipulation of elections. He tries to “protect” us with a Muslim ban, but not from gun violence. And note that last year Americans were less likely to be killed by a Muslim extremist (one chance in 19 million) than by an extremist for being Muslim (one in three million).\n",
      "Arlie Hochschild, a sociologist who has written a book about Trump voters, “Strangers in Their Own Land,” says that leadership is about focusing on the future — technology, information, renewable energy — while Trump embraces nostalgia.\n",
      "“He’s looking backward, not forward,” she told me after we watched the speech. “This is not leadership in a real sense. This is cheerleading, but for yesterday.”\n",
      "Some of Obama’s failures enabled Trump. Obama was weak on Syria and Myanmar. He also never renounced the first use of nuclear weapons, laying the groundwork for Trump’s Pentagon to contemplate a nuclear strike in response just to another country’s serious cyberattack.\n",
      "The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the “Doomsday Clock” to two minutes to midnight, the closest it has been to midnight since 1953. It warned that “to call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger.”\n",
      "The person in Davos who I thought exhibited the most leadership was Malala Yousafzai, who powerfully called on governments to ensure education for the 260 million children worldwide who are not in school. Government leaders must know that education is important because they send their own kids to school and universities, she said, “but when it comes to the rest of the world’s children, they struggle a bit.”\n",
      "When the most mature leader around may be a 20-year-old university student, the world is in trouble.\n",

      "Type 2 diabetes was once known as adult-onset diabetes. But now that term is outdated: Increasingly it is a disease that begins in childhood.\n",
      "Between 2000 and 2009, the rate of Type 2 diabetes in children jumped more than 30 percent — and it is climbing especially fast among children from poor and minority families. The prevalence of the disease doubled in the last decade among black children and tripled among American Indian children. Black and Hispanic children have eight times the risk of developing the disease compared with others.\n",
      "Faced with these startling numbers, public health experts and arts educators have teamed up to try a novel approach to preventing the disease in young people. The campaign, called The Bigger Picture, aims to get teenagers and young adults to view the diabetes crises in their communities not just as a medical problem related to poor diet and a lack of exercise but as a social justice problem tied to stress, poverty, violence and limited access to healthy and affordable foods.\n",
      "At its core, the program, created by the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and Youth Speaks, a nonprofit arts group, uses art to confront diabetes in youth. Poet mentors and doctors have been conducting workshops in poor communities, where they educate high-risk youth about the epidemic and provide a platform for them to create spoken-word poems to express how diabetes and obesity affect them. The youth perform their poems live at public high schools and turn them into music videos filmed in their neighborhoods.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "An article released on Wednesday in JAMA  highlights some of the latest spoken-word videos, which were released on The Bigger Picture website and spread via social media. Among the new videos is one entitled “The Longest Mile,” by Tassiana Willis, a young poet from San Francisco whose family has been hit hard by diabetes. Tassiana describes growing up in a poor community where family trips to fast food outlets were a “tragic tradition” that ultimately led to obesity.\n",
      "“This is about how I starve myself before blood work, praying it doesn’t pick up the candy from my last time of the month,” Tassiana says in her poem. “This is my battle between diet and dialysis, about being stuck between two Burger Kings, and never having it your way.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The videos contain rich and at times startling detail about life in communities roiled by gun violence, poverty and food insecurity. They tell the stories of families where amputations, strokes and other complications of diabetes are the norm. One video, “Perfect Soldiers,” is written and performed by Gabriel Cortez, a young poet who laments seeing his relatives struggle with diabetes, a disease, he says, that “is as common in our family as heartburn.” He talks about his grandfather, a military veteran with a habit of consuming multiple sugary drinks daily despite suffering from diabetes.\n",
      "“At 66, we are scared that another stroke could do what no war ever could and cut him to the ground,” Gabriel says in his video poem. “He drinks, like aunt Maritza didn’t lose both of her legs to diabetes last year, like half of our neighborhood doesn’t look like the emergency ward of a hospital, like he hasn’t seen the pictures: How it is impossible to tell the difference between a roadside bomb victim, and someone who just forgot to take their insulin.”\n",
      "The program is in part the brainchild of Dr. Dean Schillinger, a co-founder of the U.C.S.F. Center for Vulnerable Populations and a primary care doctor at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Dr. Schillinger began his career at the hospital in the 1990s in the throes of the AIDS crisis, when nearly half of his patients were dying of the disease. Dr. Schillinger witnessed the number of cases plunge as activists, public health experts and the medical and scientific communities came together. But then the obesity crisis began and a new wave of disease flooded San Francisco General.\n",
      "“The AIDS ward is now a diabetes ward,” Dr. Schillinger said. “Maybe one in 15 patients had diabetes when I started 25 years ago. Now one in two of my clinic visits are with patients who have diabetes.”\n",

      "Between 2008 and 2013, Dr. Schillinger served as chief of the Diabetes Prevention and Control Program for the California Department of Public Health. In that role he saw up close the rapid spread of Type 2 diabetes among children, and he was particularly struck by the link between the disease and socioeconomic status.\n",
      "Looking at maps of San Francisco, he said, he noticed that diabetes hospitalization rates differed tenfold from one neighborhood to the next, driven by factors like income, education levels, segregation and soda consumption rates. While the public discourse around Type 2 diabetes tended to revolve around “shame and blame” — the idea that people who develop the disease knowingly make bad choices — Dr. Schillinger looked at these diabetes hot spots and began to think of the crisis as a social and environmental problem.\n",
      "Many of his diabetes patients live in poor neighborhoods awash in fast food chains, liquor stores and billboards advertising junk foods. With severely limited incomes, his patients are often forced to purchase the cheapest, highest-calorie meals to feed their families, which often means choosing packaged goods and fast foods instead of fresh produce. Many are riddled with chronic stress from poverty and the threat of violence in their neighborhoods.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“I have many patients who say they will not let their kids go outside and play after school or after dark because they’re afraid of gangs and shootouts,” he said.\n",
      "One day he attended a Youth Speaks event where he saw an overweight 16-year-old girl perform a poem about her body image issues, her addiction to junk food and the diabetes that runs in her family.\n",
      "“She was describing how she was eating cupcakes even as she wheeled her aunt who had diabetes and kidney failure into her dialysis appointment,” he said. “It was basically a food addiction poem in the context of the diabetes epidemic, with the addiction being a consequence of poverty, stress and insecurity. There were so many forces acting on this child that the pathways inevitably led to diabetes.”\n",
      "A light bulb went off for Dr. Schillinger and for James Kass, then executive director of Youth Speaks. With funding from the National Institutes of Health, the U.C.S.F. Diabetes Family Fund and other sources, they started The Bigger Picture project in San Francisco and spread it to seven other regions across California. The spoken-word poems have been presented to over 10,000 high school students and viewed 1.5 million times on YouTube.\n",
      "The Bigger Picture team hopes to conduct a study to see if the campaign has any long-term impact on obesity or diabetes rates among youth. In the meantime, they say their goal is to change the national conversation about Type 2 diabetes. They say the young poets are removing the stigma around the disease and calling attention to the fact that it is often impossible for people to make good choices when their options are limited.\n",
      "“To make healthy choices, you’ve got to have healthy choices to make that are accessible and affordable,” said Natasha Huey, a poet and project manager for The Bigger Picture. “I would really challenge folks to take $5 and walk through the neighborhoods that a lot of our young folks are coming from and feed themselves healthfully. It isn’t easy, and that’s why this isn’t a conversation about individual choices; it’s about systems.”\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a fierce believer in America as a land of immigrants, recently attended a dinner party with a so-called Dreamer. When she pleaded with him to help young undocumented immigrants like herself gain legal status, he hesitated — the House, he said, would pass only legislation that President Trump would sign.\n",
      "He again held back last month after the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted him over their conclusion that Republican aides on the House Intelligence Committee had leaked the private text messages of a senior senator to Fox News. The senators asked for no specific action, and Mr. Ryan offered none.\n",
      "But when Mr. Trump challenged Republican free-trade orthodoxy, Mr. Ryan — a fervent advocate of trade accords for decades — had to respond, albeit four days later and through his press secretary. The speaker, his spokeswoman said, was “extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war” that could be sparked by the president’s steel and aluminum tariffs.\n",
      "On one contentious issue after another — the investigation of Russian interference in American elections, trade, immigration and gun control — a speaker who rose to prominence as an outspoken, almost brash leader, determined to bring his party along with his vision of governance, has receded. Instead, he wields his gavel gingerly.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Even on one of his signature issues, free trade, he has mostly worked behind the scenes to change the president’s mind.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“I think Ryan’s expectations had to be dramatically reduced when Trump became president,” said Peter Wehner, a onetime adviser to former President George W. Bush who is close to the speaker. “I think in a lot of ways he was forced into a defensive posture rather than an offensive posture.”\n",
      "To supporters like Mr. Wehner, Mr. Ryan’s approach is pure pragmatism and smart politics. Facing a divided Republican conference and a mercurial president of his party, they say, he has little choice but to curb some of his own instincts, work behind the scenes and steer Mr. Trump gently. He also must guide House Republicans into a very difficult midterm election campaign, where his main job is to ensure that vulnerable members get re-elected. And those close to Mr. Ryan note that, with the exception of trade, he has not had serious policy disagreements with the president.\n",
      "But Mr. Ryan had modeled himself as a different kind of leader, the youthful face of a new brand of conservatism that was to broaden his party’s appeal and move it beyond 1980s-style Reaganism. His 2012 run for vice president lifted his national profile and fortified his standing. So to critics, the leader once described as “the intellectual center of Republicans in the House” has abandoned principles to hang onto a job he ostensibly never wanted.\n",
      "“I’m tired of saying deep in his heart there is a different Paul Ryan,” said Charles J. Sykes, a conservative commentator and former radio host in Mr. Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin, who for years promoted Mr. Ryan as a potential presidential candidate.\n",
      "Conservative critiques of Mr. Trump, from senators such as Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have gone beyond policy disagreements, to temperament, defenses of democratic institutions and law enforcement, and the conduct of foreign policy. And other Republican leaders are speaking out. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is giving almost daily speeches on the Senate floor pushing for action on a modest but bipartisan bill to fortify the existing background check system for gun purchases.\n",
      "Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee and a loud supporter of Mr. Trump, nonetheless scorched his tariffs as “a tax hike the American people don’t need and can’t afford.”\n",
      "Mr. Ryan has repeatedly urged Mr. Trump to abandon the tariffs in private, according to one person familiar with their conversations. In public, he has held his tongue. He declined to be interviewed.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“I always imagined that there was room for an alternative conservative vision to Trumpism, and Paul Ryan was ideally suited to be that leader of a non-Trumpist conservative Republican Party, but he’s chosen not to assume that role,” Mr. Sykes said. “It’s very disappointing to see he’s become so comfortable as an ally and an enabler of Trump.”\n",
      "For Democrats, the speaker’s deference to Mr. Trump is the stuff of ridicule — and a constitutional dereliction of duty by the man three steps from the presidency.\n",
      "“Can you imagine Tip O’Neill or Sam Rayburn or any of the portraits in this gallery saying, ‘I don’t know whether I can be for that, I’ve got to go down the street and ask permission of the president’?” asked Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, referring to previous speakers whose portraits hang just outside the House chamber.\n",
      "To be sure, Mr. Ryan has had some achievements, notably the rewrite of the federal tax code, which for the speaker marked the realization of a long-held dream. He pushed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act through the House, only to see it die in the Senate. And he helped negotiate a two-year budget deal that should bring some peace to Washington even as it balloons federal spending.\n",
      "“Speaker Ryan has taken on all the challenges of the modern speakership and deftly kept the conference united while advancing an historic conservative agenda,” said Mr. Ryan’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. She cited in particular the tax code rewrite and the budget deal’s provisions for “the rebuilding of our depleted military.”\n",
      "Mr. Ryan has not always been so deferential. When Mr. Trump attacked a Mexican-American judge during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Ryan called the comments the “textbook definition of a racist comment.” When the infamous Access Hollywood tape came out, showing Mr. Trump boasting of sexually assaulting women, Mr. Ryan saw to it that Mr. Trump was disinvited to a rally in Wisconsin.\n",

      "“They’re from entirely different worlds,” Mr. Wehner said. “That said, Ryan knows he has to deal with Trump, and Trump has probably figured out he has to rely on Ryan.”\n",
      "Now 48, Mr. Ryan became the youngest speaker since 1869 when he was elected to the post in the fall of 2015, replacing John A. Boehner, who was effectively pushed out by conservatives in his unruly conference. Mr. Ryan told his colleagues then that he would accept the speakership only if all factions would unite behind him.\n",
      "To a certain extent, he has succeeded.\n",
      "But in the name of unity, he has governed with a light hand. Last month, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted Mr. Ryan after they concluded that the House Intelligence Committee had leaked a senator’s private texts — a serious breach of protocol. Although the senators raised concerns about the direction of the committee under its chairman, Devin Nunes of California, Mr. Ryan apparently chose not to intervene.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“The speaker heard the senators on their concerns and encouraged them to take them up directly with their counterparts,” said his spokeswoman, Ms. Strong.\n",
      "If Mr. Ryan is known for one quality, House Republicans say, it is his willingness to listen. Members of his conference view him as “inclusive and fair,” said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.\n",
      "But in a chamber where 218 votes are required to pass legislation, Mr. Ryan still faces the same fundamental problem as his predecessor: He has difficulty bringing his fractious conference together. That means he must watch his step.\n",
      "Unlike Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, who was speaker from 2007 to 2011, he is not a forceful presence in the House chamber. As speaker, Ms. Pelosi ruled the House with an iron fist, guiding dozens of bills large and small into law. She engineered passage of even doomed bills like a climate change bill that died in the Senate — and likely cost Democrats seats in the 2010 Republican landslide. She emerged as the undisputable face of her caucus, to some members’ chagrin.\n",
      "That is not Mr. Ryan’s style.\n",
      "“It’s hard for anyone be a strong speaker in the traditional sense around here because the speaker is only as strong as his conference allows him to be,” Mr. Dent said. “And because on many issues the speaker cannot get 218 Republican votes, that weakens his position.”\n",
      "Apart from the tax overhaul, that has made for narrow legislative proposals. With Republicans under intense pressure to address gun violence after the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Ryan swatted away any suggestion last week that the House would take expansive action.\n",
      "The chamber has already adopted a measure to make modest changes to the national instant background check database, coupled with a measure pushed by the gun lobby to expand the reach of concealed weapons permits. The speaker said Republican leaders now are waiting for the Senate to act.\n",
      "“I’m not going to micromanage this,” he said at a news conference.\n",
      "But there are consequences to Mr. Ryan’s low-key style. Big issues like immigration are languishing with no resolution in sight. Causes that were once Mr. Ryan’s signature fights — an exploding budget deficit, soaring Medicare and Social Security spending and an entrenched welfare state — are on nobody’s must-do list. Even Mr. Boehner, never viewed as a policymaking powerhouse, at least tried to negotiate a “grand bargain” with the White House that was to slow entitlement spending, cut other parts of the government and raise revenue to balance the budget.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Mr. Ryan’s break with Mr. Trump on trade came only after several other Republicans made clear that they were not standing by the president. Republicans are running for re-election on the strength of the economy, hoping that voters credit their policies, especially the tax cuts. But a trade war marked by a spike in consumer prices could jeopardize their survival strategy.\n",
      "To Representative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and a combat veteran who lost both his legs in Afghanistan, Mr. Ryan’s suggestion that the House wait for the Senate to act on guns is not good enough after the Parkland slaughter.\n",
      "“If we believe that tax reform is a do-or-die issue that we have to get done but we can’t say that protecting our kids is that same kind of issue, then that’s not leadership,” said Mr. Mast, who backed an assault weapons ban after the bloodshed in Parkland.\n",
      "Conservatives, meanwhile, have put Mr. Ryan on notice that he does not have free rein. Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was instrumental in the ouster of Mr. Boehner, and he suggested last month that a misstep on immigration in particular could cost Mr. Ryan his job.\n",
      "“I can say that it is a defining moment for this speaker,” Mr. Meadows said then. “If he gets it wrong, it will have consequences for him.”\n",

      "The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis is a monument to a movement, and to its leader. It offers crucial insights for 2018, and for the future.\n",
      "By HOLLAND COTTERMARCH 28, 2018\n",
      "\n",
      "MEMPHIS — March for Our Lives, the student-driven protest against gun violence. The Millions March against police violence. The Sacramento protest over the fatal shooting of Stephon Clark. Had he survived, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would have been there, walking, talking, listening, present, as he was for countless body-on-the-line campaigns for social justice in the 1950s and ’60s.\n",
      "He was organizing a march in the final days of his life. On April 3, 1968, he came to Memphis on what was a fast return trip. A peaceful demonstration five days earlier in support of black city sanitation workers had ended in a panicked rout when militant protesters stirred up the crowd, and the police came down hard. Now he was back.\n",
      "That night, at a local church, he delivered his apocalyptic “Mountaintop” speech. People cheered. His mood brightened. He spent much of the next day, April 4, at the black-owned Lorraine Motel, waiting for the city to approve a permit for the second march. When it finally came through, he relaxed. Everything would be O.K.\n",
      "Around 6:00, he strolled onto the balcony outside his second-floor room and bantered with friends in the parking lot below. There was the crack of a gunshot. He staggered and dropped.\n",
      "Dr. King’s death shook the nation, inspired outpourings of grief, rage, and in some quarters, relief. Two months later, Robert F. Kennedy was killed and mourning shifted, the news cycle moved on. In the years that followed, the Lorraine Motel slowly fell into disrepair until, in 1991, it was rescued and reopened as the National Civil Rights Museum. An expansion in 2014 brought in new visitors. And the 50th anniversary of the King assassination, coming now as it does in a politically sundered, racially fraught year, should bring in more, with a special exhibition, starting April 4, comparing contemporary events like the Occupy movement and the Living Wage Campaign with King’s Poor People’s Campaign and sanitation strike.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "What they’ll find in its permanent collection is a monument to a movement and, secondarily, to a man, in a display that focuses on difficult, sometimes ambiguous historical data more than on pure celebration. And they’ll find, if they are patient, useful information for the 2018 present, and for the future.\n",
      "The shape of the story told by the museum is chronological, a narrative of African-American life that starts with colonial slavery, moves through the long Jim Crow era, and then lingers over the civil rights events of the 1950s and ’60s: the bus boycotts, the Freedom Rides; the Washington march; the Birmingham children’s crusade, the Selma-to-Montgomery walk for the vote; the Memphis strike.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "It’s a story of high contrasts: good versus bad, right versus wrong. And the museum presents it that way. In windowless, black-box galleries, objects are picked out in pin spots; words and images glow on digital screens. They are the visual equivalents of references to light that glint in Dr. King’s speeches, to “luminous brotherhood,” “the sunlight of opportunity,” “the radiant promises of progress.” He called the Memphis strike another step on the journey from “the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.”\n",
      "Such imagery has always been part of popular accounts of the movement. In another Southern museum, the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, which opened in Jackson, Miss., late last year, the galleries are, as in Memphis, somber and shadowy, but they open onto a central hall furnished with benches and holding a big sculpture made of swirling, pulsating light. The message: history is grim, but it’s also redemptive. You can break for uplift any time.\n",
      "The Memphis museum uses light to dramatic effect, but in a very different way. After you’ve walked though sequential decades of history, you arrive at 1968, instantly recognizable from a mural-size image by the Memphis photographer Ernest C. Withers of sanitation workers carrying protest placards reading “I AM A MAN.” You pass through a narrow passageway and suddenly the artificial twilight you’ve become used to becomes daylight.\n",
      "You are inside the Lorraine Motel, on the second floor, outside Room 306, Dr. King’s room, visible through a cutaway wall: turned-down beds; open suitcases; coffee cups, sunlight seeping through curtains — preserved mostly as it was when he died. And just outside the room is the balcony door. You look through its window and see where Dr. King fell and, some distance away, the back of a building, the former rooming house — now part of the museum — from which his killer took aim. (James Earl Ray died while serving a 99-year sentence.)\n",
      "Unlike the museum’s other displays, this one is minimally theatrical: real-world light falling on plain, real-world things. Also, it’s a dead end. Your pilgrim’s progress into history is, abruptly, over. If the civil rights movement extended beyond April 4, 1968, you don’t learn that here. Your choices are either to return the way you came or head for a closer exit.\n",
      "The story the museum tells stirs emotions but leaves them unresolved. In many ways the experience, whether intended or not, is in sync with the political atmosphere of the country today. Uplift feels anachronistic; progress is cut off; the future left unimagined.\n",
      "Dr. King may have shared similar feelings. In our journey through the museum, he has been our Virgil, our calm, sage guide through the hell and heaven of postwar racial history. In Room 306, he becomes our frustrated, anxious contemporary.\n",
      "When he checked into the Lorraine on April 3, he was in a dark mood, not just from the first, failed march, but from a political environment that had turned unpredictable. His speech that night was a sonorous movement pep talk. But there was regret in it. It was mortality-tinged:\n",
      "“Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people will get to the promised land.”\n",
      "I wonder if, at that point, he really believed we would get to this “promised land” of racial harmony anytime soon. By that point, integration was, technically, reality, with Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kan., and the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. But so was the anger, both black and white, that the fight for equality had generated. By the mid-1960s, Dr. King was sensing that the nonviolent resistance he had built his reputation on was inadequate. He continued to preach an ideal of reform-through-love, but he was starting to think about “a radical revolution of values.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "He was thinking global. It had become clear to him that racism was not a stand-alone evil. It was an organic element in a disease complex that included capitalism, colonialism and militarism. In 1965, in a break with his assigned public role fighting racism Dr. King spoke out against the war in Vietnam. It confused supporters and earned him vindictive enemies. By the time he checked into Room 306, he was, for good reason, feeling vulnerable and fatalistic. He had been to the mountaintop; but he had hit some valleys too.\n",
      "My guess is that if Martin Luther King Jr. of 1968 were to return to 2018 America, he would be unsurprised by some of what he’d find: the staggering numbers of black men in jail; the recurrent killings of unarmed black youths by police; the emboldened presence of white supremacism. As a leader, he shaped a great humanitarian movement; as a thinker, he came to understand humanism’s deep flaws.\n",
      "I wonder what he would think about how we engage with the history he helped create. A glance at contemporary art might give him some clues. In 1988, the African-American artist Glenn Ligon took as a subject a foundational civil rights emblem, the “I AM A MAN” strike placard, and did several things to it simultaneously: He replicated it, customized it, and critiqued it.\n",
      "He turned it into a painting. In doing so, he paid homage to the mass-printed original; he gave its adamant words a new, queer dimension (Mr. Ligon is gay); and he turned an activist artifact, one that functioned as demand for economic equity, into an elite museum object, its text now done in glossy, light-catching enamel. (The painting is currently on view at the National Gallery of Art in Washington,  in honor of the King anniversary.)\n",
      "On multiple levels, Mr. Ligon made a piece of civil rights history his own, though attempts by other artists to do something similar have backfired. A recent example is the painting “Open Casket” by Dana Schutz, in the 2017 Whitney Biennial. The source of the image in this case was also a movement icon: a 1955 post mortem photograph of Emmett Till, a black teenager who, after being accused of whistling at a white woman, was murdered. At his mother’s insistence, Till’s tortured body was put on public view and photographed. The pictures, printed in Jet magazine, are credited with bringing many people into the civil rights movement, among them Dr. King.\n",
      "At the Whitney, the painting sparked protests by some black artists who demanded its removal. At issue was that Ms. Schutz is white. Dr. King’s initial vision for the civil rights movement was one of racial harmony; blacks and whites working together to achieve equal lives for all. Possibly in those early days, Ms. Schutz’s painting might have passed as a gesture of solidarity.\n",
      "But by 1968, it was clear, even to moderate blacks, that sharing power was not likely to happen. For the Whitney protesters, “Open Casket” was an emblem of the continuing exercise of white privilege that, in this case, allowed a white-controlled museum and a white artist to lay claim to a sensational image of black pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suspect that the Dr. King of Room 306 would have understood the protesters’ point. In his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, given in 1964, when he was 35, he said that he could not, would not, permit himself to envision a world in which humanity was “so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality.” But over the next four years, as Vietnam ground on, civil rights activists met violent ends, and race wars laid waste to American cities, daybreak must have seemed far-off.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "To idealists of the 21st century, it may seem that on many social, economic and ethical fronts the country has come to what seems a futureless halt, just as the museum’s civil rights story does. But rather than exit the scene in weariness or frustration, we would do well to go back in time. If we stay alert, we can find instruction there.\n",
      "The emphasis of the present-day protest movements is on inclusion: equal salaries, equal education, the right to marry. The goal is to get a share in the system. The civil rights movement began with that goal too, then realized that the system was the problem. Dr. King eventually came to this conviction, and in some ways it made the end of his life hard, complicated and unsettled.\n",
      "Other people, however, held that view all along, and many of them were women. Sexism was rampant within the movement leadership. Women were expected to make coffee, make nice and stay home. Some, like Ella Baker, a tireless civil rights organizer, refused. True monuments have yet to be raised to enough of these women. One, Fannie Lou Hamer (1917-1977), was a monument herself.\n",
      "A Mississippi Delta field worker, she was jailed and beaten when she tried to register to vote at 46, but went on to run for Congress. Her televised testimony, to determine whether she and her all-black Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party could be seated at the Democratic National Convention, is in the National Civil Rights Museum. Hamer’s unscripted account of her jail experience, with its blunt challenge — “I question America” — is overwhelming: dark and incandescent.\n",
      "In May 1963, in Birmingham, Ala., Dr. King organized the most brilliant civil disobedience campaigns of his career, when he brought more than a thousand black schoolchildren into the streets to demonstrate against segregation. Hundreds were arrested; others were blasted with fire hoses. When people rebuked Dr. King for putting young people at risk, he said: “Don’t hold them back if they want to go to jail. For they are doing a job not only for themselves, but for all of America and for all mankind.” The world reacted, shamed the city and Birmingham took its first steps toward desegregation.\n",
      "It occurred to me while I was listening to Hamer that her equivalents today may be Black Lives Matter and #MeToo. And the Children’s Campaign lives on in March for Our Lives and #NeverAgain. Dr. King, at the end of his life, set for himself a goal that all worthy leaders might strive for: to live a life of “dangerous unselfishness.” In 2018, this could yield an imaginable future.\n",
      "The sermon Dr. King gave the night before he died was somber and cautionary but also gave reason for hope. “Only when it’s dark enough,” he said, “can you see the stars.”\n",

They pointed to 2004, when the AR-15 re-entered the gun market after the end of the federal assault weapons ban, at a time of heightened interest in the military. It was popularized by the rise of a video game culture in which shooting became an accessible form of mass entertainment, and it was marketed as accessible and easy to personalize.\n",
      "For those who love the rifle, it is seen as a testament to freedom — a rite of passage shared between parents and children, a token to welcome soldiers home, a tradition shared with friends at the range. But in its relatively short life span, the AR-15 has also become inextricably linked with tragedy and has been vilified as the weapon of mass murder.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Nineteen-year-old Nikolas Cruz confessed to gunning down 17 people last month at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in which an AR-15 was used, the latest mass shooting to prompt a new round of the intractable gun debate.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Whether beloved or reviled, the AR-15 is more than just a gun for much of the United States.\n",
      "Light, precise and with little recoil, the Colt Armalite Rifle-15 Sporter hit the market in the early 1960s as the first civilian version of the military’s M16 rifle. What set it apart was, much like its military counterpart, the inventor Eugene Stoner’s patented gas operating system, which allowed for rapid fire and reloading. The weapon could easily handle a 20-round magazine, was easy to disassemble and was marketed, in one of Colt’s early advertisements, to hunters, campers and collectors.\n",
      "Billed as “America’s rifle” by the National Rifle Association, the AR-15 is less a specific weapon than a family of them. When Mr. Stoner’s rights to the gas system expired in 1977, it opened the way for dozens of weapons manufacturers to produce their own models, using the same technology. The term AR-15 has become a catchall that includes a variety of weapons that look and operate similarly, including the Remington Bushmaster, the Smith & Wesson M&P15 and the Springfield Armory Saint.\n",
      "Over the ensuing decades, as the American military modified the M16’s exterior to allow for accessories such as sights, grips and flashlights, the civilian market followed. Today, gun enthusiasts consider the AR-15 the Erector Set of firearms. Online message boards, video games and advertisements all provide how-to guides for customizing the rifle.\n",
      "But the guns were taken off shelves after President Bill Clinton signed a law in September 1994 banning what Congress called “assault weapons.” Prompted by a string of mass shootings — including one in 1989 in Stockton, Calif., in which five children were killed and 32 wounded in a schoolyard — the legislation stopped production of civilian rifles like the AR-15, and introduced the term “assault weapons” to the public.\n",
      "The number of assault weapons recovered by the police in crimes and reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives dropped sharply after the ban was carried out, according to a Justice Department report.\n",
      "But it stops short of directly tying the ban to a decrease in gun violence, and the ban’s broader effect remains in dispute. Gun rights advocates say loopholes allowed for the sale of slightly modified versions throughout the ban. Its defenders cite law enforcement statistics showing a drop in the criminal use of automatic and semiautomatic weapons during that time.\n",
      "The number of rifles manufactured in the United States has steadily increased since the ban ended through congressional inaction when the ban sunset in 2004, though it is not clear how many are semiautomatic firearms. Some 3.7 million rifles were manufactured in the United States in 2015, according to A.T.F. data.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Determining the true effect of the ban is all but impossible because federal regulations prohibit the government from tracking the guns. Though gun industry lobbyists touted the popularity of AR-15s, no public information is available on how many Americans own them, where they are bought or concentrated or exactly how many exist.\n",
      "Culturally, the ban did what marketers could not: In outlawing it, the government made the AR-15 tantalizing.\n",
      "“If you want to sell something to an American, just tell him that he can’t have it,” said Mark Westrom, who owned Armalite, the gun’s original manufacturer.\n",
      "When the ban ended, enthusiasts could finally buy what for a decade had been forbidden.\n",
      "And when the AR-15 reappeared in gun stores that fall, American culture had changed. Now, this civilian-model military rifle was being sold amid not only a swell of anticipation but also post-9/11 patriotism and at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n",
      "Special Operations forces were being mythologized in news segments, shown carrying their rifles through the desert in imposing tactical gear. Children were shooting the AR-15’s military equivalent in wartime video games. Manufacturers designed rival versions, creating a competitive market that made the AR-15 more affordable.\n",

      "Chris Cerino, a former federal law enforcement officer and firearms instructor in Ohio, said he hated the AR-15, until he used one. “It was so fun to shoot,” said Mr. Cerino, 48. Now, he and his wife, who has a purple AR-15, love them.\n",
      "“It’s an icon,” he said. “It’s a symbol of freedom. To me, it is America’s rifle.”\n",
      "Critics say the firearm’s branding positioned it for notoriety. Josh Koskoff — a lawyer who represents parents of victims of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in a lawsuit against the gun manufacturer Remington — cited a concerted effort by the gun industry after the assault weapons ban to use the AR-15 to shape popular opinion around semiautomatic weapons — rebranding them as “modern sporting rifles.”\n",
      "“When they market it to young men, there’s no ‘sporting rifle’ angle to it,” Mr. Koskoff said. “It’s all military. It’s all violent. And it’s all incendiary marketing.”\n",
      "Indeed, the AR-15 is also inextricably linked to tragedy. Mass shootings are central to the gun’s narrative, and its popularity. Police departments stocked up on them after a string of massacres in the 1990s. Some supporters attribute their fondness to fear of being outgunned should they encounter an aggressor. Hobbyists, like Mr. Swarey, 23, have swarmed to gun shops after mass shootings, fearful that they could be a catalyst for the government to outlaw them again.\n",
      "“It was right around the time of the first school shooting that made the news and scared everybody,” Mr. Swarey said of buying his first AR-15 about five years ago, when, he said, the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was fueling talk of another assault weapons ban. “It was one of those things, that I wanted to get one before they were impossible to get.”\n",
      "Compared with pistols, assault rifles are used rarely in shootings. According to F.B.I. statistics, 374 people were murdered with any kind of rifle in 2016; 7,105 were killed by a handgun.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But the AR-15 has been a recurring character in some of America’s most infamous violent crimes. Adam Lanza used his to kill 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook. Stephen Paddock used an enhanced AR-style gun to kill 58 concertgoers and wound hundreds on the Las Vegas Strip in October. A month later, Devin Kelley murdered 26 congregants with a Ruger AR-15 variant at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex. And the rampage last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., renewed calls for assault-style rifles to be banned — a common refrain after mass shootings.\n",
      "It is unclear when and how the rifle worked its way into the United States’ lexicon of violent crimes. In 1982, George E. Banks shot to death 13 people with the weapon, and in 1997, an AR-15, among other semiautomatic military-style rifles, was used in the North Hollywood shootout, a daytime robbery in California that devolved into a nearly hourlong firefight and was televised live across the country. During the gun battle, police officers were forced to run to a local gun store and take rifles to try to contend with the robbers’ firepower and body armor. Afterward, police departments around the country started making AR-15s standard issue for officers.\n",
      "Mr. Koskoff, the lawyer for Sandy Hook victims, criticized the marketing of the AR-15 as hypermasculine and inflammatory, aimed at attracting young men, “ringing the bell of the lone gunman.”\n",
      "“What we’re seeing right now with the increasing velocity of shootings with AR-15s is a little bit of a ‘chickens coming home to roost’ scenario,” he said. “They sold so many to so many, and so indiscriminately to this younger demographic, that it’s just become a risk that increases with each sale.”\n",

      "The scene as described is painfully familiar. Someone snaps, for whatever reason, and sets off on an “aggressive, homicidal, frenzied attack.” In short order, “a lot of people lie dead, and there’s blood everywhere.”\n",
      "Those words could have readily applied to the American cascade of shooting rampages. But the speaker, Geoffrey Robinson, a professor of Southeast Asian history and politics at the University of California, Los Angeles, was instead offering a glimpse of what life was sometimes like two centuries ago in lands that are the modern Malaysia and Indonesia.\n",
      "A man — it was almost always a man — would feel he had endured an unbearable indignity. After a period of brooding, he lashed out by attacking everyone in sight with knives or other sharp weapons, hacking away until fellow villagers or the authorities finally killed him.\n",
      "This was the true meaning of running amok, a word derived from the Malay “mengamok,” which roughly means making a furious, desperate charge. For Professor Robinson, there are unmistakable parallels between those long-ago “amokers” and today’s mass killers in the United States, and also possible lessons to be learned. Behavior patterns are not immutable, he told Retro Report, a series of video documentaries examining how past developments inform modern events. By the end of the 19th century, Malay men mostly stopped running amok.\n",

      "In this installment, Retro Report explores how the change came about and whether there is hope for the same in violence-plagued America.\n",

      "For now, the picture is unquestionably grim. Hundreds of mass shootings occur every year, most of them receiving little or no national attention. Gun Violence Archive, an online tracker of the mayhem, defines that type of shooting as an assault in which four or more people are killed or wounded. The archive recorded 324 such incidents nationwide this year through November, with at least 415 people killed and 1,725 wounded.\n",

      "Our society is, obviously, heavily armed. So were the Malays of the past, with daggers, swords and spears. There was even an honorable quality to a man’s running amok, knowing that it would almost surely end in his own death. “He would become part of the story of that village and the story of his family,” Professor Robinson said. There was, he said, a certain “aura” to it, not unlike the notoriety that many of today’s mass killers seem to seek.\n",
      "That aura faded during colonial rule in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. The authorities changed tactics, discouraging villagers and the local police from killing a man who ran wild. Instead, Professor Robinson said, they arrested him or packed him off to an institution. That drained the rampage of heroic quality. “Eventually,” he said, “it loses its appeal.”\n",
      "Whether comparable tactics can work in the United States is in question. For starters, some mass killers turn their guns on themselves right after their carnage, so prison or a mental hospital is out of the picture. And the British and Dutch colonialists had no Bill of Rights to obey. The Second Amendment complicates any attempt to confiscate the arsenal of even a man known to be deranged, and the First Amendment makes it virtually impossible to stop news organizations from writing extensively about a mass killer — and possibly creating copycats in the process.\n",
      "Nonetheless, a reason to study the Malay experience for Professor Robinson is to learn how perhaps the past might be prevented from dictating the future. Mass killing, he said, “is not an irreparable kind of problem of the American psyche or American society. These things change.”\n",

      "I believe that someone with authority should be armed on school grounds at all times. Whether that person is a teacher or a police officer there should be someone there to defend the future of America. The amount of teachers or officers armed should increase for the number of students within the school. Arming teachers would act more as a precaution than anything else, if a student is aware there are weapons on school grounds the chance of them shooting up a school would decrease. If I knew there were trained adults concealing weapons at my school I would feel very safe. I would know that in the chance there was an active shooter in my school, I wouldn’t be left defenseless.\n",
      "Sarafina Alamurda disagrees, and thinks teachers should teach:\n",
      "Teachers should not be armed with guns. Guns are the reason that school shootings were able to take place and adding more guns to schools would not help save lives. Trump said, “I want my schools to be protected like I want my banks to be protected”, but a school is not a bank and it should not be treated like one. A school should be a safe place where students can learn and if teachers were armed, students would be in constant fear of their teachers. Police officers are already able to kill people without consequence and teachers should not be added to that list. Another point that Trump brought up was “a little bit of a bonus” given to armed teachers. How would teachers get enough money to have proper gun training when they don’t even have enough money for school supplies? It is not practical to purchase guns for teachers and training with guns where teachers need materials to do their job; teach.\n",
      "LKD from California said both gun control and gun training were needed:\n",
      "We need to get weapons of war off our streets, let the hunter have his riffle let the housewife have her hand gun but no 18yr. needs a weapon like that. If it would make parents, students and teachers feel safer to have a gun then sure, have a guns in school. Also the person with a fire arm has to be handed by a highly trained teacher.\n",
      "Sophia Cinnaminson from New Jersey said we must limit guns:\n",
      "Having more guns would just cause more shootings and access to these guns. In order to control guns, you must limit them. Having fire arms in school would also cause students to feel less safe and more likely to be targeted if you are in a heated situation, you would always have to watch your back. This would distract students from learning because they will constantly be worried about someone who isn’t a police officer is carrying a weapon.\n",
      "John Burgee from Wilmington, N.C., said enhanced security outside buildings would be a good step:\n",
      "I believe that training and arming educators with firearms isn’t the right thing to do in this contentious situation. If we are trying to prevent guns from being in school, then why contribute to the problem by equipping teachers with them? Trump stated, “I want my schools to be protected like I want my banks to be protected”, which may not sound like a terrible idea for some people. Although, we really can’t afford for there to be access to more weapons on school grounds, especially at this point. A principal at a high school out of Mississippi-Joel Myrick said “Teachers have to teach, and that’s what they should be doing,” which I definitely can acknowledge. Arming and training teachers will put an extreme amount of pressure on themselves, already troubling over 100 students and then on top of that having to protect them from a psychopathic gunman is a lot to handle. Instead, I think we should aim towards better enhancing security in our schools. This could range from increasing the amount of highly trained officers around the campus to just being more discipline of who enters and exits the building. I feel that letting those know that there is advanced security on school grounds will make them feel safer and make people think twice when attempting to do something as awful as what happened in Florida earlier this month.\n",
      "Anna Cross from Wilmington responded emphatically:\n",
      "NO. TEACHERS SHOULDN’T HAVE GUNS. Most teachers aren’t ex police officers or soldiers, and while you can train someone to fire a gun, it’s another thing to point and shoot it at someone. Teachers are just like the students in the sense that they want to survive a crisis situation, and whether all of them would be able to confront an intruder and hold a gun to their head (possibly the head of one of their students) is debatable. Neither are they trained to handle the effects afterwards, as Mr. Myrick said he had “acute stress for about six months afterward. Nightmares. Misery.” following the day he detained a 16 year old gunman in 1997. I understand that parents want their children to be safe at school, but placing their children’s lives in the hands of the kids’ algebra teacher is an unreasonable expectation. Furthermore, there are loads of dangerous situations that could stem from teachers bringing concealed carries onto campus, including the possibility of a future shooter obtaining one of these authorized weapons and attacking students and faculty. Making teachers bring guns to school is just the NRA trying to solve gun violence by selling more weapons, a solution that doesn’t require better background checks or halting the sale of military-grade weapons to the public. They refuse to address the real problems, and unfortunately, that’s costing innocent people their lives.\n",

      "Maxwell Hayden from Alameda Community Learning Center likes the idea of armed teachers:\n",
      "I personally believe that arming teachers with guns is the correct thing to do. At my school, when a “lockdown” drill is called, the only thing students and teachers can do is sit in the corner of the room an pray that we are not seen. As it turns out, keeping the teacher in the room armed would make me feel way better about my chances of survival. If a teacher feels uncomfortable armed, that’s okay: as the article mentioned, only 10-40% of teachers need to have access to a gun. Teachers could also keep each other in check if something scary does come up, but that’s what background checks are for in the first place. Finances might be hard, but Trump himself comments that federal money could be allocated to this issue. I believe the costs are relatively low to arming teachers, and the payoff is potentially tremendous.\n",

      "Tina Harrell from Cinnaminson thinks schools should spend the money to increase security, but not arm teachers:\n",
      "Teachers should not be armed in school. All schools should start with having better safety precautions. It would mean putting up lots of money to get cameras, metal detectors, and barricades, but isn’t the money worth it to save the lives of students and school faculty members? It would cost money to arm teachers with guns. In my opinion, adding more guns to the equation does not prevent a school shooting from happening. It can only allow the teacher to take the life of the school shooter, after they probably already had shot up some of the student body. Nothing is going to completely stop this infamous phenomenon, so we should do what is best to make it harder for it to happen.\n",

      "I myself wouldn’t feel safe knowing that teachers in my school have an armed weapon in their classroom. If teachers are given guns, then a lot of work and preparation will have to go into it, that may take away time from others things requiring a school to possibly take more money out of their banks to aid staff in things like courses and even the weapon itself. Another reason why I don’t believe teachers should be armed is because there will be more guns within a school which could possible create problems. Yes, guns are typically locked in a safe and kept somewhere, but where would they be kept? A classroom? A closet? Would a kid or an even an adult have easy access? A thought I have, which may be a stretch is that if other people are aware that guns are in the building they could plot to break into a safe and take one. Also If guns are not kept in classrooms (which is near children) will teachers even be able to get to their guns in time? I think rather than incorporating guns into the classrooms we should be educating people and creating safer environments without the use of weapons.\n",

      "Abby Tank from Wilmington plans to try local cuisine when she travels:\n",
      "I am quite the foodie, there’s few foods that I wouldn’t try if I’m being completely frank. I’d say that the most unusual food I’ve ever eaten was escargot. While eating snails might not sound appetizing to many people (me included before I ever got the courage to even look at the plate- let alone eat it). But I have to say, the combination of butter, garlic, a dash of parmesan cheese, and snails will leave you craving for more. Other exotic foods that have graced my taste pallets include alligator, frog legs, seaweed, caviar, and even raw octopus, although, mine wasn’t moving like the octopus from the picture. I enjoyed every single one of those unusual foods and wouldn’t hesitate if given the opportunity to eat them again. I think it’s very unfortunate that so many people who are attending the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, are sticking to Domino’s and McDonald’s instead of trying local cuisine. Many restaurant owners in South Korea hired more part-time workers in anticipation of the tourists they’d receive during the Games, but as we find out in the article, that hasn’t been the case. If I were to visit another country, I would definitely try the local cuisine no matter how strange. Most of the unusual foods I’ve tried I ate during my trip to Europe a few summers ago. This summer, I will be traveling to Ecuador, and I am 100% without a doubt going to try the local cuisine. I absolutely cannot wait to see all of the new foods I am going to try.\n",

      "The most unpleasant food I’ve had I would say is crickets. It wasn’t very appetizing nor the tastiest treat ever. I am all for tasting new things and giving different types of dishes from different cultures. My family actually has a diverse style of cooking, since they have many experience from starting off by working in restaurants and meeting different people from different cultures. They create a bond through food, teaching each other their most popular dishes or favorite meals that they enjoy and later sharing that with their families. I like to be very open minded to trying new things and would definitely consider trying a local cuisine from a foreign country, even though I’m not sure about trying octopus because it freaks me out just by the look of it.\n",
      "Jillian Lancaster from Wilmington is familiar with exotic fare:\n",
      "A few years ago, I would’ve said that it was unthinkable that someone would ever eat live octopus, but after visiting the night markets in Taiwan, I know just how strange exotic foods can get. From giant scorpions to big cherry tomatoes in a candy coating (I thought they were strawberries but when I took a bite- surprise! they were not.) to various seasoned bugs, there was nothing that the night market hadn’t fried and put on a stick. Before my family left the market though, we had to try a local delicacy dubbed “stinky tofu”. Basically, it was rotted tofu that the locals had grilled in a wok. I’m not sure what exactly I was expecting, but when I took a bite, I tasted what probably is the equivalent of a garbage smoothie. I was glad I tried it, but after that experience, it took a lot of dragonfruit and grass flavored candy from the Taiwanese grocery store to get that taste out of my mouth.\n",

      "Patrick Losee from Wilmington said he would — and had — used nepotism to his advantage:\n",
      "I see nepotism as using a perfectly sensible leg up. Not using it when it’s available is like trying to play the piano with one only hand. Although I do see why the student thinks the way that they do and that you should get a job based on merit and not social capital, because you should get it because you’re skilled. But why would you to take a hit for morals if no one else does or even cares, thus wasting a rightful advantage. Also if you think about it this way, if your parent worked at a job that you now want to work at you probably know at least a little bit already about this job because of being around someone who has worked it before. For example, my father is a lawyer and because of this I do know just a little bit more about the duties of an admiralty lawyer than my peers probably would, mind you I do not want to be a lawyer, but information is still information.\n",
      "Due to all of this I would most certainly use nepotism to get a leg up. I actually already have, mind you I haven’t gotten the job at the moment but I did put in an application at a local shop that my brother works at and my sister-in-law used to work at. So to summarize, I would and did use nepotism because I see it not as unethical abuse of social capital but as a useful advantage that should be allowed to be utilized and not looked down upon by some. Even if it’s only to get your foot in the door for an interview, then you can really take the interviewers aback with your talents.\n",
      "Tanya Bolick from North Carolina also thinks it is a perfectly acceptable way to land a job:\n",
      "While I understand the students concern about taking the internship his dad got for him, I feel as though we need to utilize the resources provided to us. I personally don’t have a real job, but being a teenage girl I am often given the chance to babysit. Most of the people I babysit for are friends with my parents. I think that since these people know my parents they find it easier to leave their children with me. They trust me more and know I will play with their kid and not just sit on my phone.\n",
      "I agree with Mr. Appiah’s advice to, “Take the internship, work hard and well, get a job and rise to the level where you can reform the company’s hiring practice”. This is a way for you to use the resources you have but also do some work yourself. This allows you to prove yourself while in a job that some may think was handed to you.\n",
      "That being said, I also believe that getting an internship through connections can be a good thing. I believe that if our parents are going to help us get internships they should introduce us to their coworkers and bosses so that we can make connections of our own, through them. Our parents get to “use” us to do chores and little things around the house. I thinks its ok to “use “ our parents a little to set our careers on the right track.\n",
      "Clay Krupp from North Carolina believes bias in hiring is unavoidable:\n",
      "Nepotism is a two lane road, some people see it as being selfish, and others see it as an opportunity. I don’t believe that using all of the resources given to you should be seen as being selfish or stealing another’s job.\n",
      "Social bias will always exist, people will always want to hire their employee’s son over a new kid straight out of collage. To end this bias we are going to have to raise awareness and try to make hiring a fair process.\n",
      "Katharine from Rhode Island wondered if the issue was more nuanced:\n",
      "As someone who has gotten a job (albeit a minor one, scoring hockey games) through nepotism, I would find it hypocritical to completely deny its effectiveness. However, I think the nepotism I benefited from was on a minor scale and done out of convenience. However, if nepotism is used to promote a family member, with no regard to their skill level, or the wellbeing of the people affected by their position, then it is unacceptable.\n",
      "Victoria Jackson from Wilmington gave an example:\n",
      "This upcoming summer, I’ll be shadowing a few doctors in the specific area that I would like to study when I get to college. I have this opportunity because of my sister, if not for her I’d spend my summer like any other teenager.\n",
      "By all means, if you have a good connection for a job, take it, but if you obviously know you’re not qualified for it or won’t work hard to uphold your family member’s reputation, don’t.\n",
      "Voltron Thunderstorm from Wilmington said nepotism was fair only in certain situations:\n",
      "Yes, I think that family connections should definitely be used to receive a job opportunity. Keyword there is opportunity. There’s nothing wrong with playing a potential advantage that you might have, and if it can play into getting you a living — I don’t really see what the problem is. You can’t live off an internship, so scoring that internship as a result of a family member is only providing an opportunity. Now I don’t think it’s fair if you receive a job offer because your grandfather happened to be a good friend with the boss. Occupation should be based on the ability to carry out that job effectively — otherwise there’s an inefficiency in the system. There isn’t anything wrong with receiving a chance because someone close to you is creditable, the issue is when you receive the job whether you’re good at it or not.\n",

      "Commenters found deep meaning in the Picture Prompt “Person,” and we were interested to learn whether each reader found something new.\n",
      "Zac from Wilmington understood it this way:\n",
      "This image pushes for something we both need and deserve, equality. A single look at these two hands one white, one black, and I understood exactly what was being conveyed. No matter what you look like, no matter your race, religion, or gender, we are all people and should be treated as such. Upon a closer second look, I paid more attention to the red string tied to both fingers. The red specifically got me thinking. It put images of love and acceptance into my head, though it also painted pictures of violence and anger. I saw the string transition from a jumbled mess to organize itself and spell the word “person.” To me, this image is representing so much more than equality alone. I see the anger and violence in the disorganized string directly resemble the years of disgusting treatment of people of color in our nation. After the disorganization fades a more refined and focus message is shown. I believe in today’s society more and more people are starting to look past all of these superficial qualities and understand there’s something more. Look at Black Panther for example, a critical and financial powerhouse with an all black cast, black writers, and a black director. I’m not trying to say racism has been eradicated there are some very obvious problems that need to be addressed. Everyday we are getting better whether it be the marches for equality or acceptance of different races and religions into popular culture. We are getting better, and this picture celebrates that.\n",
      "Mitchell Boehling from Wilmington analyzed the colors:\n",
      "To me this picture represents humanity as a whole and that now matter our many differences we are all still people. The fact that the string is attached to both hands supports this and the knot is tied tight to show that it can’t come undone. The importance of this is also shown through the colors portrayed on the picture. The four main ones pink, white, black, and red all each mean something different but when their together they form a meaning. The meaning of the colors to me are that the pink stands for love and it’s importance in our society and how it’s what ties us to our humanity. The other colors black and white are meant to show how love brings together differences and makes them the same. The red could represent that although on the outside we maybe different on the inside we are the same because in the end we all bleed red.\n",
      "Andrew Derushia from Wilmington considered the string tying the hands together:\n",
      "People all around the world try to focus on the difference between us and this segregates us. This image is depicting a red thread connecting hands of different race. The thread connecting the two writes out “person” after being jumbled. The formation of “person” from the messy stage illustrates how we have a connection as people, even though we don’t see it at first. The connection may also being depicting if we tug on hour thread the other hand will be affected, and that we all have a part to play in other people’s lives. A biological allusion that may surface with the red string, is that we all bleed the same color.\n",
      "Beyond the physical symbols, this pictures is calling on us to see the similarities within each other instead of our polarities. Ultimately this animation is pushing to instill a feeling of unity among its viewers, which is definitely needed today with all the racial, religious, and political divisions we deal with today.\n",
      "Nancy Taylor from Greensboro, N.C., interpreted it differently:\n",
      "The string tied around the finger is a very old custom to remind you of something you need to, well to remember.\n",
      "By joining the string from a dark skinned hand to a white hand says to me that we need to constantly remind ourselves that a great as our difference may be we are all joined together as a species, as humans first and the rest is just perception.\n",
      "Brooke from Wilmington connected the illustration’s message to current events:\n",
      "Person. People. Human beings. When I look at this picture I see the colorblind connection that all people have to one another. I see the plea from the artist for people to remember, as represented by the bow tied around the fingers, that despite our differences we are all human. Humans that should be accepting of all people. This artist is simply trying to exemplify how despite skin color, sex, religion, political view, how we are all still human beings that need to stand united.\n",
      "I have no idea when this image was created but I’d like to think that the NYT chose to use this image as a writing prompt to remind our nation that we are all people that need to stand together in this time of terrible unrest. With the recent shooting in Florida, debates across the country have been initiated tearing people apart and forcing them to take sides. I think we all need to remember that issues like these are not partisan problems, that they are people problems. We cannot let tragedies like Parkland tear us apart anymore than it already has, we need to unite as people, people without prejudices, to make decisions that will best serve the people, not sides, of our nation.\n",
      "And Cheyenne Newkirk from Wilmington shared this perspective:\n",
      "Why does everything need a label, why can’t a simple word just take on a meaning that hides below the surface. I think that is what this picture means. Person may not seem like a strong word but sometimes to get through things all you need is one person. They can be your mom or your middle school friend. A person sometimes is all you need to be able to pick your head up and keep going.\n",
      "I think that the ribbon represents the connection that two people can have, yet how fragile it can be. Sometimes like the article mentions we fall in and out of love. Some things aren’t meant to last. But someone will come along that you just connect with and feel free with, then you’ll know that they are your person.\n",
      "My person is my best friend in my old town. About 12 hours of road separates us but if when we see each other we pick up like nothing has changed. She will tell me about school, and that boy, or how she had a really good sandwich yesterday. No matter what it is … I know I have her to count on.\n",
      "The article explains how BFF may not be a strong enough word, but I think that no word can be strong enough for someone you call your greatest friend. You could read a million dictionaries in a million languages and you may never find a word so right, and fitting to describe that person. I think what’s more important is letting that person know that they will always be your, well … person.\n",

      "After subdued celebrations in Norway following the country’s impressive Olympic wins, we wanted to know: “Has Modesty Ever Prevented You From Celebrating an Achievement?”\n",
      "Hudson said celebrating well-earned victories was appropriate:\n",
      "Norway should be very proud of their accomplishments. I mean 39 medals at 1 olympics is outstanding for a country like Norway. These athletes train for 4 years straight for 2 weeks of competition and if that were me I would be very happy to know that it all paid off and be recognized as one of the best in my sport. Don’t get me wrong be boastful to the other teams is wrong but winning something because you have earned it and celebrate because of it fits into my definition of modesty just fine.\n",
      "Abbey Skinner from Danvers, though, believes humility is an admirable quality:\n",
      "I think that it shows good character of Norway; instead of openly displaying pride in their achievements at the Olympics, they are being modest about it so they do not come off as “bragging”. Modesty is a great thing to have because it spares the feelings of others who maybe did not do as well at something that you excelled at and sharing your success would only make them feel worse. I do however believe that in bigger cases like this with the Olympics, Norway should feel like they are able to celebrate their achievements because it is on such a larger scale that it would not seem as though they are bragging as it would if it was a student celebrating they got a hundred on a test in front of another student who got a 50.\n",
      "This is something that I personally experience a lot in my life. Many times my friends will talk about how they all did so bad on a test that I did really well on and usually I will just stay quiet in order to spare their feelings and not seem like i’m bragging and boasting that I got a good grade. Other times modesty is important after my team wins a game; many times instead of celebrating in front of the other team we will wait until we get into the locker room.\n",
      "And Jordyn I from Westfield, N.J., said “modesty is a necessity”:\n",
      "Modesty is a necessity. It is what keeps our feet on the ground, and our heads in reality. It is easy to get overly fixated on accomplishments, but with just a little bit of modesty the downfalls can me appreciated too.\n",
      "Aubrey Ella Hyldahl from Wilmington suggested that placing too much value on humility could be damaging for some:\n",
      "Norway is unique in wanting to down play accomplishments at the Olympic level, but I think that it is custom almost everywhere to take modesty so far that we are hindering our pride and confidence that comes from accomplishment. This issue is especially prominent with women. From a young age we are taught not to be boastful, to win with grace. Good advice, right? Nobody wants a graceless winner. However, the problem starts when women take away from their accomplishment to make others, especially men feel better about themselves. The amount of times I have heard women say things like, “oh, it was just luck,” or “You deserved it more, the only reason I got this was … (insert ‘excuse’ as to why a woman did something better)”, is remarkable and sad. Or what about the classic storyline of a man feeling inmasculine and uncomfortable because their significant other is in a higher powered job or makes more money, leading to the demise of the relationship? The culture around women and success is just like in Norway with the fear that they are winning too much. Modesty is a good thing when it is not self-deprecating and full of double standards. Modesty is not reducing yourself to save somebody else’s’ feelings — it is being proud and thankful for success while not using it as a weapon against others, but unfortunately that belief standpoint has been and continues to be left behind.\n",
      "Isabelle Silva from Massachusetts saw benefits and drawbacks to downplaying one’s accomplishments:\n",
      "Personally, when I experience success, I am similar to the Norwegians in that I remain humble and feel there is no need for celebrations; one who never seeks attention. Modesty can be good in certain situations but binding in others. Recently, I toured colleges and met with a field hockey coach. When asked about myself, I almost forget to mention some of my achievements; one in particular — my recently earned captain-ship. My modesty and fear of being too boastful almost prevented me from sharing something great. For me, my humbleness can sometimes get in the way of sharing, or even remembering that I am successful; and I have realized that success should be celebrated, not ignored.\n",
      "Bella Cankurtaran from Wilmington identified with Norway’s humility:\n",
      "When I was younger, my mother told me stories of her embarrassment when her professor would announce her perfect grade for each test. She would keep her head down and just shrug it off. I can remember questioning her actions, thinking if I ever got a better grade than my classmates, I would be proud and flaunt my achievement. Turns out my mother was right. My first year taking Spanish was a breeze. The concept felt so natural for me and while my classmates were struggling, I would be making one hundreds. I received cold glances from my friends as they whispered that I was such a try hard. I could do nothing more than keep my head down and shrug it off.\n",
      "That’s why I don’t blame Norway’s concernment for their insane medal count. I can empathize their feelings for a grand achievement that is envied by others. Keeping it on the down low is the only way to escape that especially when you are “one of the world’s richest countries”. The country is used to being humble so staying this way will be normal. Also, a strong point the article brought up was if the Norwegians completely dominate cross-country skiing, the other countries will lose hope and stop trying so hard. Their duty of modesty is to keep their favorite sport alive and ongoing, and there’s no shame in that. While I do believe Norway should celebrate these athletes a little for their history made at the Games, it is apart of their culture to remain humble and apart of their passion for winter sports to let them reign on.\n",

      "There were so many excellent comments for our Student Opinion prompt “How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?” that it was difficult to select just a few.\n",
      "Logan B. from Wilmington said human interaction was diminished:\n",
      "With dating apps on the rise there is much less human interaction in the initial stages of dating. Most people think that this is a bad thing but some might like it. There are many people in college that are too afraid to go out and try to meet new people at a bar but those people are perfectly comfortable when that can have a conversation before their fist date, whether it’s over an app or over text message. In the opinion article that relates to this question Caleb Keyes of Otterbein University, Class of 2018 said that “In high school I had always wanted to date but struggled to believe anyone would want to date me. When I got to college those fears were compounded …” Some people are just more comfortable using dating apps than trying to meet strangers, and that is something that we are going to have to accept as technology becomes a bigger part of our lives.\n",
      "Victoria Jackson from Wilmington thinks dating apps are shallow:\n",
      "Constantly in media false ideas of relationships are portrayed. Often times, we conjure up this idea that dating is supposed to come naturally, feel comfortable, and be dreamy. But then we go out in the real world and are faced with the hard truth that dating is anything but what it seems to be in the movies. I’m sure the makers of dating apps thought they were doing everyone a favor, but what they seem to be doing according to Madeline Apple, is “[killing] the college dating scene. Because it’s so easy to swipe left or right on a seemingly endless pile of potential partners, it’s become harder to actually meet anyone.” Tinder is an incredibly shallow dating app. You could probably spend hours swiping on “potential matches”, only those “matches” don’t lead to many relationships. If you see something you like, you swipe right. It’s not like you get to know that person before you decide that they’re worth swiping for. I personally think that emotion has been taken out of the equation of dating. A perfect example, from what I’ve heard from many users of Tinder, is it’s not geared towards dating, when someone swipes right, they’re not thinking about what your interests are, they’re thinking about how they can get you to spend the night. On another token, on dating websites, people are able to say however they feel. Often times, what they say online, contrasts what they’d say in person, which is usually an awkward experience. Dating online has caused us to forget how to socialize.\n",
      "Nikki Tinnerello from Wilmington warned about catfishing:\n",
      "Dating apps as we all can agree on have definitely changed the way people connect and find love … or well maybe just hookup. As the article mentioned, Tinder has been popularized as just a one night stand kind of ordeal, I mean how often do you hear someone say, “I fell in love at first swipe!” The idea of Netflix and chill less of a meme now than it is just plain reality. In my opinion apps such as Tinder have taken the reality away from love, turning deep connections and long conversations to get to know one another into shallow meetups. And to top it all off you gotta add in the factor of catfishing, it’s hard to trust and meet someone you don’t even know is real, which could not only lead to heartbreak, but something much more dangerous.\n",
      "Kaley Nesselroade from Wilmington said real connections were lost:\n",
      "I believe that texting is an important aspect of getting to know somebody. A lot of times people are more comfortable behind their phones and are more willing to express their feelings through text message than face to face. However, texting also comes with miscommunication due to the lack of personal interaction of hearing the intention behind the words used. I agree with the article that “Dating apps may have killed the college dating scene.” By using an app like Tinder, and endlessly swiping left or right, people are unable to form real connections. They get caught up in the excitement of it all which makes finding a long lasting relationship that much harder. For me personally, I would never see myself using a dating app. I realize that some people find their soulmate and live happily ever after, but the chances of that over the internet is just too unrealistic. I would prefer meeting someone in the old fashioned way by just letting it happen. Social media has a way of taking out the personal interaction that is necessary to develop a meaningful relationship. If I lived in an era where I could only text or call someone, I would be perfectly happy.\n",
      "Brooke from Wilmington thinks people need to redefine dating by putting phones down and looking around instead:\n",
      "Technology today has defined how we as a society “date”. I think that it has affected how we communicate with others for better and for worse. While technology can be incredibly helpful for people in long distance relationships, I think there is an aspect of dating that you lose by only getting to know each other through your phone. I’ve heard my parents talk about “how things were different back in my day, we had to go out and socialize”, and I think that there is a great truth to this. It’s bad enough that social media dictates our lives, and it’s even worse when we substitute swiping left or right for meeting people face to face, real human interaction. When you are talking to someone via social media or your phone it becomes so easy to hide who you really are behind the illuminated screen. It’s so much harder to go deep beneath the surface of the “u up?” conversations online and this is causing people to have falsified ideas of what dating and relationships are supposed to look like. I think our society needs to redefine dating by putting down our phones and taking a look around everything and everyone right in front of us.\n",
      "James C from North Carolina said face-to-face was best:\n",
      "Technology has affected dating tremendously. Instead of having to actually go outside and try to find the right girl or guy, people can just sit down and use their phones. This is definitely not how relationships should be formed. Technology has made what is supposed to be a loving and caring connection to a person become emotionless. If you can’t already tell this is what Tinder and other dating applications have done to people looking to find a meaningful relationship. Anybody can act great and seem like a great guy or girl when they put down fake things and lie about themselves online, but when it is in real life it is special. Nothing in the world of technology will ever bring two people together more than being face to face with one another. Technology has made dating so much worse, and should not be a factor in who you find for a relationship.\n",
      "Michael DiCenzo from North Carolina said even texting had changed how couples interact:\n",
      "I strongly believe that technology has affected dating. The app Tinder has ruined the whole experience of trying to find that right fish in the sea. This is also causing people to be preyed on by social media creeps. Even texting has ruined the experience of meeting up with someone and asking how their day was. Even if you go out on a date now a days, you see couples just staring into their phones. Couples are becoming brain dead to what true love really means. Technology makes everyone on a quick conversation format; How are you today and bye. Friendships are not what they were used to be either. In my opinion we should put it down go find that special someone like how it was meant to be. Adrianna dimone from Wilmington, N.C., said tech dating is awkward: When technology is the way, you first meet someone it tends to be awkward in person. It is so much easier to say whatever over the phone or in text, and usually you feel more shy or uncomfortable in person. The example for the writer of the passage explaining how in college she used tender, how she says all the people you see on there see you to. When she was to go out in public people recognized her and she felt embarrassed because all tender is for is to some company your feeling lonely but can usually the connection or first look at each other your eyes lock with theirs. You feel comfortable with them but also talking over the phone leaves out so much from seeing what you love most about that person, from their smile or to the way they play with their hands when their nervous.\n",
      "Brennan Litzinger from Wilmington said overuse of technology could lead to cheating:\n",
      "I definitely think technology affects dating and relationships. Anyone can make a profile on an online dating app and the person you meet could be totally different than who you were texting in the app. I believe that it could worsen relationships because if couples are just sitting down and watching Netflix, they aren’t actually talking. I think this could hurt their relationship in the long run. Couples are also more likely to cheat in my opinion with the overuse of technology in their relationship. As the article said, “Someone I was dating made a friend online which developed into something more, and I was blindsided by it.” I know that technology is a necessity in this day and age, so I think you and your partner should have an agreement on how to use it.\n",
      "Elliott O’Deen from North Carolina thinks people only show the best parts of themselves online:\n",
      "Everything changes over time. The way people hang out, the clothing people wear, the cars people drive. With time technology will get more and more advanced and we should be able to utilize it but not depend. If you abuse the easy swipe left or right, you might miss someone or not see who a person actually is because everyone is a different person online and only shows the best parts of themselves. If someone has little quirks and cute things they do that they are embarrassed of, that you think are cute, you might never know that and see the real them because you never had a real conversation. If you can’t talk to people and talking to people online helps you and you carefully pick who to swipe on, you might actually find someone. Some people are introverted and would rather talk online first and others are extraverted and not need the assistance of an app. I think people should meet up more and hang out face to face and actually get to know people before they make assumptions but also use what we have because, yes, some people go on 4 dates a week and never establish real connections and others need an app to find people just like them.\n",
      "Emily Duran from Rhode Island said technology played too big a role in dating today:\n",
      "Personally, when it comes to dating I find that technology plays too big of a role. Apps such as Netflix have become a new way of dating. Many couples decide to do things including technology such as Netflix dates, or begin to communicate on social media platforms more often then real life. I find that technology can have both negative and positive effects to relationships. For one, it can help make communication easier, but at some points can also detract from in life communication. I think there needs to be a balance between what we leave to technology, and what we should leave to face to face interactions. However it’s not all negative because dating apps can help bring two people together who might not have been able to meet before.\n",
      "Sydney Durner from Wilmington said all dating was uncomfortable:\n",
      "Any type of dating can be extremely nerve-racking. There are so many expectations that come with dating. Technology has made it easier to meet new people who live near you and have similar interests to you. Although, online dating is highly casual as opposed to someone you have known for a while and see very often. As one of the articles mentions, “the same snap asking to ‘hang out’ sent at 2 p.m. can have a completely different meaning when sent at 2 a.m.\n",
      "Most online dating apps meant for young people, such as tinder, are tailored for the “hooking up” crowds, people who want someone to be with, but not for long. These relationships are very casual. They are great for meeting new people, but most “tinder relationships” don’t seem to workout.\n",
      "Technology is a great way to communicate with your boyfriend, girlfriend, or potential love interest that you don’t get to see very often. Yes, you do have the occasional missed text, like Kasey Roper mentions, but if you can’t see this person every single day, texting, snapchatting, calling, and video calls make up for those lost hours and can bring the two of you closer.\n",
      "Emilia Cordon from Wilmington said online dating was less honest:\n",
      "I am not a huge proponent of online dating but still see, and reap, the benefits of technology as a means of communication whether we are friends or more. It is a great way to talk to people, because nowadays everyone is busy and can’t always meet.\n",
      "Online dating is the exception. It leeches the true meaning of dating by putting it an algorithm and letting it rip. People are meeting on these sites by the dozen, and quantity is not the same as quality. Rather than opting for a dating site, just meet people and make connections. Sure, not everyone will be relationship material, but at least you are meeting people and probably making friends.\n",
      "Another problem is that people are less intimidated online which does more harm than good. It means that people are less likely to be honest and more likely to feel comfortable behind the mask of the internet. This is scary because you can speak to someone online and think you know them, then see them in person and doubt this. This is a horrible feeling and really makes a person think, is your relationship isolated to the internet or actually more.\n",
      "Relationships are to be made in person, supplemented by the internet, not the other way around.\n",
      "Monalene Delo from Wilmington said online dating broadened the dating pool for everyone:\n",
      "Dating in today’s world can be very stressful. Meeting people and being social can be intimidating. There are so many apps to meet people. Social media has become the new outlet to meet people. As referenced in the article it is more common to ask someone you like for their Snapchat, then it is to ask for their phone number. We are in a different time with dating. It is a lot different then it use to be. There are definitely a lot of pros and cons, with so many risks. On one hand it gives us great opportunities to meet new people and increase our connections in society. On the other hand we don’t know who is a genuine person just trying to meet someone nice and someone that could be a danger. Interactions with people can be way different online than in person for numerous reasons. One being that it is easier to say things behind a screen than in person. Dating has never been easy, I don’t think that there will ever be a time when it’s going to be easy to put yourself out there. Also mentioned in the article is how social media has transformed the dating scene, which is very true. I think the current dating world we are living in gives us a lot of opportunities to meet people, which is exciting. Because people never use to meet anyone other than someone that lived near them. Overall I do think that it has improved relationships.\n",

I’ve wanted to run down to her house regardless of mileage, and hold up a boombox playing her favorite song out on her front porch and see her smile. Since 2012, dating has changed drastically and for the worse. Not just Tinder, but Match and E-harmony have messed with dating for ages by convincing us to see complete strangers that we only know a few facts about. The increase of texting and snap chatting may make us more social, but you don’t build that human connection that our parents and their parents. How am I supposed to build up the confidence of a face to face communication if we spend so much time speaking through screens, how am I going to stand in front of a Nissan holding up a Bluetooth brick, or even see her real smile. Tinder in colleges doesn’t help especially because it’s lustful curse. Think about it, if you use the app and get three swipes back, you could possibly have a class with those same three people. College is a time for you to take care of yourself, not going around with your pants down knocking on every door. Dating needs to be when you stay with somebody because you enjoy the time and interests they share with you, not just because of their shape or selfies.\n",

      "LONDON — Her Majesty was present.\n",
      "London Fashion Week ended with an unusual visitation, unannounced except by the blue velvet cushion that appeared on her seat just before the final show started: Queen Elizabeth II had arrived.\n",
      "She turned up at Richard Quinn, for Mr. Quinn’s second show since his graduation from Central Saint Martins, the art and fashion school here. Sitting between Caroline Rush, the chief executive of the British Fashion Council and Dame Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, she beamed through the show of allover prints, piled atop one another — coat, dress, bag and shoe. Mr. Quinn had added some extra scarves in homage to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "CreditRegis Colin Berthelier/Nowfashion        \n",
      "“She’s always been an icon,” Mr. Quinn said. “You see a matching bag, shoes, coat and you kind of think of her anyway.”\n",
      "She ascended at its end to present Mr. Quinn with the first Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design. The queen wore one of her customary Easter egg-toned suits. Mr. Quinn wore a T-shirt and cap.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“She was saying how she really liked the florals and the colors in the collection,” Mr. Quinn said in an interview the next day. “She said that award was really appropriate, with the big flower.” (It was designed by her longtime wardrobe adviser, Angela Kelly.)\n",
      "It was a fitting end to London Fashion Week, where high and low are often in proximity. There were triumphs to be found, but London is dogged as every fashion week is by the concerns of the industry: struggling retail, outdated protocols, the question of what, in fact, a fashion show is even good for.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“It’s a chaotic moment,” said Christopher Bailey, the outgoing president and chief creative officer of Burberry. “As an industry, I think we’re questioning our behaviors, our values, the ways we’ve historically done things. There is so much turmoil.”\n",
      "Against that backdrop, and the roar of regular anti-fur protests outside many of their shows, London designers looked to reinvent even as they soldiered on.\n",
      "“How do you crack the back of everything and go forward again?” Jonathan Anderson asked backstage at his J. W. Anderson show. “We’ve been going for 10 years now. We have to go forward in an optimistic way and change it, to make it exciting again.”\n",
      "For optimism, he offered a collection of outdoorsy resilience, less fussy and fashionable than many of his previous ones. He had brought his men’s and women’s collections together for the first time since the early days of his career, and the combination seemed to cool and calm them both.\n",
      "Mr. Anderson will probably never give up his allegiance to the odd, but here was terrific proof that he doesn’t have to: drop-waist dresses toggling between pleat and plain, mac skirts and great knits, and swoopy leather trousers that buckled at the ankle (nominally for men, although Mr. Anderson noted that women have been buying his men’s collection, too).\n",
      "His changes aren’t merely cosmetic. He is streamlining and simplifying his shows and his business, combining his men’s, women’s and pre-collections, and holding an open search to find the photographer for his next ad campaign, but those will mean less to his customer. What will mean more: Here were terrific clothes.\n",
      "A change is coming to Burberry too. After 17 years — a lifetime, in fashion terms — Mr. Bailey presented his final collection, which he titled “Time.” A swan song, but not a retrospective.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“I didn’t want this collection to be some maudlin sad thing,” he said. “I wanted it to be optimistic but talking about the past as well.” (There’s that word again, “optimistic,” one that crops up when optimism is needed, rather than in ample supply.)\n",
      "It’s a noble sentiment, to go off on a note of newness. But it’s also a bit of a shame. Over the course of his years at Burberry, he took what was once a trench coat supplier and pushed it to the forefront of British fashion. Even if his recent collections have fallen a bit off the mark, he has earned a victory lap.\n",
      "\n",
      "CreditGio Staiano/Nowfashion        \n",
      "His new collection was a thrift shop-style mix of bits, a jumble of tracksuits, logo-fied sweats (a new/old Burberry logo retrieved from the 1980s and ’90s archives to compete in the yet-again logo-saturated luxury market), clompy sneakers, printed shearlings and so on. He seemed to pour most of his passion into rainbow-striped pieces — rainbow even worked into the Burberry check — to telegraph support for L.G.B.T.Q. communities. (Burberry will also make a substantial donation to L.G.B.T.Q. charities, the Albert Kennedy Trust, the Trevor Project and the ILGA.)\n",
      "When Cara Delevingne sashayed out at the end in a rainbow-striped, check-lined faux fur cape to the strains of “I Feel Love,” she brought an energy the collection generally lacked. A rainbow light show followed. Burberry, the giant of London, is capable of fireworks when it pleases.\n",

      "Yet the sirens and shouts of protesters outside, who bedeviled Burberry for the second season in a row, provided an unwelcome reminder that reality waits nearby. As the shows unfolded, America was reeling from its latest episode of gun violence; Britain remains perched on the edge of leaving the European Union. And the #MeToo moment has not spared fashion: In the middle of the show week, a report published in The Boston Globe on Friday included allegations of harassment against several top fashion photographers and a top fashion stylist. (Several of the photographers named in the Globe article and Karl Templer, the stylist, have denied the accusations.)\n",
      "And still fashion week keeps its mulish course, a carousel spinning madly.\n",
      "What is fashion’s responsibility to, and in, a fractious world? It’s not a bad question, though few designers are explicitly wrestling with it. There was a nice visual joke in the first stand-alone runway show by Matty Bovan, one of the week’s highlights. Mr. Bovan is a young, York-based designer who has been taken up and championed by the industry’s elder statesmen, like Stephen Jones, the milliner on call at Dior, who made the fabulous net-wrapped Mylar balloon headpieces that floated above Mr. Bovan’s finale models.\n",
      "“Carrying the weight of the world on your head,” Mr. Bovan said, “in a very stylish way.”\n",
      "But many others insisted on fashion as a space apart, looking away from now (as did Erdem Moralioglu, whose collection felt stuck in his imagined history and not especially current) or away from the street (like Mary Katrantzou, whose showpieces are worthy of — and often best suited to — a museum, like the Dallas Contemporary, where a retrospective of them is on exhibit, but often best suited to one).\n",
      "\n",
      "CreditGuillaume Roujas/Nowfashion        \n",
      "The designer Dilara Findikoglu, most extreme of all, imagined her own separate utopia, safe from the predations of the present: a “Dilaratopia,” where, as she wrote, “escaping a world of Trumps and Weinsteins, here our lives belong to us, and us only.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Or as Michael Halpern, who spares no sequin in pursuit of glamour, put it: “It is a resistance dressing however glamorously you want.”\n",
      "Maybe it is. Mr. Halpern can seem to have a one-track mind in his relentless pursuit of a disco — Taana Gardner’s “Work That Body” was thumping away on the soundtrack — though he insisted his clothes are not necessarily only for parties. The woman who wears Mr. Halpern’s half-zebra, all-sequin jumpsuit for a morning subway commute has my compliments. But personally, I don’t believe she exists.\n",
      "Christopher Kane’s collection was a frisky, focused celebration of peekaboo: dresses in plasticized lace, others that zipped or gaped open or shut. Black leather, crushed velvet. It’s hard to shock a fashion week crowd at this late point in runway provocation, but Mr. Kane’s finale dresses, printed with illustrations of copulating couples from the ’70s bible “More Joy of Sex,” managed it. Of course they came in shades of nude. Of course they were trimmed in marabou. When you’ve come this far, you go all the way.\n",
      "Is all the way too far? At present, it’s hard to say. But too often the fashion industry equates boundary pushing with creativity, and provocation with inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "CreditRegis Colin Berthelier/Nowfashion        \n",
      "Mr. Kane insisted that he had a right to continue in his own creative vein.\n",
      "“It’s not in any way about disrespecting what’s happening,” he said. “My clothes are about empowering women. It’s always about empowerment for me.” Whether women are empowered by crystal-encrusted “cage” dresses depends, one must suppose, on who is wearing them. (Mr. Kane is the only designer to show customized sneakers by Z-Coil, an orthopedic sneaker brand on whose spring-heeled, pain-reducing soles some of his models bounced.)\n",
      "Mr. Kane is in no way responsible for the abuses and excesses of the industry, but neither is he exempted from them, and the designer has found himself in the unenviable position of stuck in the middle. It isn’t easy to be a lightning rod, I thought on the way out, as publicists with faces frozen in rictus grins did their best to usher showgoers past another anti-fur demonstration.\n",
      "The real broke in on the fantasy. Where, it made you ask, had it been on the runway all week? You caught a glimpse of it at Anthony Symonds and Max Pearmain’s Symonds Pearmain collection, a coda at the end of the Fashion East show, a young-talent incubator.\n",
      "It was simple: knotted sweats, printed shirts, a Frankensteined rugby top. It didn’t need much explanation, nor did it warrant much. In lieu of show notes, the designers offered a page of prose in high-art gibberish by the video artist Ed Atkins: “We used to laboriously spaff no small amount of charmless arm meat down okay blue tubes, at work.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Too much in fashion feels like laborious spaff. There’s a certain provocation all its own in designing clothes to throw on and take to the streets, whether the march is in protest or pride.\n",

      "Just because something is normal doesn’t mean that it isn’t stupid.\n",
      "Take Halloween. Based on what we know about the ill effects of sugar, it’s stupid to dress our children up in costumes and send them out to collect as much sugar as they can. But Halloween is so normal that I would bet dollars to pennies that at least some of you are going to send me emails claiming heresy.\n",
      "When we engage in these normal, but stupid, activities, we feel fine about it. Sometimes, we even feel good. This good feeling leads to what I like to call normalized stupidity. Once stupidity achieves that status, it becomes almost impossible to criticize.\n",
      "Of course, letting our kids masquerade as monsters all hopped up on sugar one night a year isn’t the stupidest normal thing we do. I can think of a several things that are far more infuriating, and I’m sure you can, too.\n",
      "Gun violence in America happens enough that it is starting to feel normal. That’s stupid. Powerful men treating women as objects sure seems normal now that we’re hearing so many stories about it. That’s stupid. The United States withdrawing from the Paris climate accord is normal now that the reality of the move has had months to sink in. Clearly not everyone thinks that is stupid, but it feels stupid to me.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "We got here because it’s really hard to deviate from something that’s normal, even when that normal is stupid. I know this is true because just writing the previous sentences was incredibly difficult. Not to mention picking a fight about Halloween.\n",

      "And as much as I hate to use the words “healthy” and “Burger King” in the same paragraph, the company’s recent commercial about bullying is a perfect example of how simple acts of positive social deviance can change the world for the better.

      "Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman from Arizona who emerged as a high-profile advocate for tighter gun laws across the country after she was wounded in a mass shooting, endorsed Philip D. Murphy for New Jersey governor on Thursday.\n",
      "Her political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, praised Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, as a “strong advocate for responsible gun violence prevention policies.” The organization has backed candidates who are in favor of more gun control in races nationwide; this month, it announced support for Democrats running for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in Virginia.\n",
      "Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut who founded the committee with his wife, Ms. Gifford, in 2013, announced the endorsement on Thursday.\n",
      "“New Jersey’s next governor will have an important role in combating gun violence and advancing solutions to make communities safer,” Mr. Kelly said. “We believe Phil is best qualified to take on that important challenge.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "New Jersey is widely regarded as having some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence has ranked the state as having the third-strongest gun laws in the United States, and the National Rifle Association has regularly urged its members to push back against the state’s “out-of-touch, anti-gun lawmakers.”\n",

      "In recent weeks, law enforcement officials in New Jersey organized gun buyback programs in Newark, Camden and Trenton, where guns could be turned in for as much as $200 in cash. In all, 4,775 firearms, including 129 assault weapons, were collected, and state officials described the haul as a “major success.”.\n",
      "Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, has vetoed numerous gun control measures in recent years, including one that would have reduced magazine capacity and regulations that would have made it more difficult for gun owners to obtain a concealed carry permit. He has described the state’s gun laws as “overly burdensome” and supported loosening the restrictions.\n",
      "Mr. Murphy has said that he would have signed the gun measures that Mr. Christie blocked. On Thursday, he said that he supported mandatory gun safety training, blocking those with mental illnesses from obtaining guns and tightening rules on gun transfers.\n",
      "“I pledge that I will be an entirely different type of governor,” Mr. Murphy said, adding that New Jersey could serve as a “national role model” and had the potential to “prove that sensible gun safety laws can prevent violence while protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding residents.”\n",

      "Former residents of Chicago’s Cabrini-Green were thrown into a system that increasingly leaves the poor to fend for themselves.\n",
      "By BEN AUSTENFEB. 6, 2018\n",
      "\n",
      "On a December morning in 1989, amid a snowstorm, Annie Ricks let her third-oldest son, Cornelius, stay home from middle school. For months, she and her eight children had been sleeping on the floors of relatives’ apartments or in the lobby of the Cook County Hospital. She had lived on Chicago’s West Side, within the same few blocks, since moving there as a 10-year-old from a segregated mill town in Alabama. But her West Side apartment and every belonging in it had burned in a fire. Without a fixed address, she stopped receiving the public-assistance checks that had helped stretch what she earned in a factory molding plaster figurines.\n",
      "When she considered the fact of her predicament, it simply didn’t make sense: Annie Jeffery Ricks was homeless? At 33, she’d been providing since she was a teenager. Her children were well fed and neatly dressed, their hair combed and cut and braided. The girls as well as the boys played basketball, and Ricks volunteered in their classrooms and attended their games. She had never before considered public housing and knew nothing of Cabrini-Green’s reputation — that it had entered the pantheon of proper names of the scariest places in urban America. But she had put in an application and couldn’t wait any longer. She told Cornelius they were going to get their apartment that day and walk the seven miles to Cabrini-Green in the snow.\n",
      "Ricks was shown a 15-story plain box of a high-rise, a giant filing cabinet with a facade the color of cigarette-stained teeth. The elevators were out of order, the stairwells dark. Built in stages beginning in the 1940s on Chicago’s Near North Side, Cabrini-Green consisted of barracks-style rowhouses and 23 towers. When Ricks arrived, more than a third of the 3,600 units were vacant. The Chicago Housing Authority said it couldn’t afford to do the repairs to ready them for occupancy, and not just at Cabrini. The C.H.A. had a stock of 42,000 apartments, but the number in use had fallen to fewer than 33,000.\n",
      "The vacant fifth-floor apartment Ricks entered looked like a crypt. Plywood covered the windows. The kitchen cabinets dangled or were missing altogether. Ricks surveyed the surroundings, counting four bedrooms. There was a full bathroom on one side of the unit and a half bath on the other. The front room was large enough for a dining table and a sofa, and it was connected to the kitchen, which (she checked) had a working stove and refrigerator. The ceilings were high, the walls made of seemingly indestructible cinder block. Ricks had freckles that wandered the bridge of her nose and reached her high cheekbones, which now sharpened to points as she smiled. What she saw looked like a home.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Ricks lived at Cabrini-Green for the next 21 years. She worked as a teacher’s aide in the local schools that most of her own (eventual) 13 children attended. She babysat, ran an after-school program and served free lunches out of the field house by her high-rise. She moved her aging mother in with them, and Ricks’s grown children found jobs in construction, home health care, retail and at a new residential complex built atop the old Madison Street “skid row,” an area refashioned into the “West Loop.” Ricks didn’t leave Cabrini after one of her nephews was hit with several bullets through her apartment window — his heart stopped twice before he survived. She stuck it out as the city demolished every other public-housing high-rise in Chicago not reserved for the elderly, including all the towers at Cabrini-Green save hers. After the start of this civic remodeling, in 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley said that breaking up the severe concentrations of poverty of high-rise public housing would finally imbue long-neglected neighborhoods with vitality; the mostly black residents who lived there in social and economic isolation would be able to reap the rewards of the resurgent city. “I want to rebuild their souls,” Daley declared. But Ricks believed her soul was doing all right on its own. She refused to go, in 2010, even as every neighbor remaining in her building took whatever replacement housing was offered them. She outlasted them all. “I’m the last woman standing,” Ricks liked to declare.\n",
      "Ricks held firm to a belief that if she followed the rules, if she kept up her part in an agreement, then she was entitled to all that was promised her. Her three youngest children — Reggie, Rose and Raqkown — were still on her lease, along with two of her nearly 40 grandchildren. She wasn’t in her apartment illegally, she contended. She paid her rent on time. No one caught her with drugs or guns. So how could the C.H.A. just assign her a new unit? But the city took her to court, and a federal judge gave her 10 days to vacate the building. That was that. “I had to go,” she conceded. “Either that or be homeless again.”\n",
      "As it had the day she arrived at Cabrini-Green, snow covered the ground on the December morning in 2010 that she left. A crowd of reporters jostled the last high-rise tenants of what had been the city’s and the country’s most well-known public-housing project. “An inglorious end to an infamous era,” as one news outlet put it. Another described Cabrini-Green as “the housing development that came to symbolize the squandered hope of them all.” Deonta Ricks lugged a cardboard box filled with his mother’s most prized possessions: the trophies he and his siblings had won for basketball tournaments and perfect attendance and the one he was awarded for being valedictorian of the school that was still there, an empty field away. The Cabrini-Green neighborhood, only a few blocks west of the ritzy Gold Coast, had a new library and police station, new shopping and upscale housing. The school, too, had been renamed and given a makeover, and it now served only those students who tested in, ranking it among the best elementaries in Illinois. Rose, then 17, rolled a suitcase with a “Route 66” sticker on it. “I’ve been here basically my whole life,” she said. “Like it’s hard leaving when you’ve got so much memories of it. You knew everyone. You felt safe.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "When the trophies were stowed and the furniture loaded onto a truck, Annie Ricks ducked into a sedan the same off-white color as her high-rise. The car spun its wheels on the snow and gained traction, and she was gone.\n",
      "The fate of public housing in America — its rise, much of it in the form of towers like Cabrini-Green, and its fall as those towers came down — is the story of urban poverty as an unsteady political priority. In his first year as president, in 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt created the federal Housing Division, as part of the Public Works Administration. The P.W.A. built the country’s first 51 public-housing developments, including three in Chicago. By then the shortcomings of the for-profit real estate market were evident in eviction riots, in sprawling homeless encampments and in cities overflowing with mile after mile of cheap, decrepit frame dwellings. In segregated black neighborhoods, where families were excluded from competing for housing on the open market, the conditions were more dire. Without government intervention in some form, private developers and landlords were never going to build or maintain anywhere near enough homes for the urban poor. Like other New Deal assistance programs — relief for farmers, aid to senior citizens through Social Security, food stamps — public housing treated poverty as a widespread social and economic injustice that the country was obligated to right. The subsidy was also intended to help jump-start the economy by rebuilding moribund cities and creating jobs. In 1937, Congress passed more extensive legislation, establishing a federal housing agency; Chicago and other cities formed their own housing authorities to operate the program locally. “I see one-third of a nation ill housed, ill clad, ill nourished,” Roosevelt announced that year. “The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.”\n",
      "Then, as now, the idea of government-run housing was maligned as anticapitalist and socialist; it clashed with a national ethos wrapped up in visions of the frontiersman and the self-made entrepreneur. When the Housing Act of 1937 was being debated, it was opposed by real estate trade groups and property owners’ associations, by builders, suppliers, the U.S. Chambers of Commerce and the departments of the Interior and the Treasury. Although the subsidy was reserved for only stable families with modest incomes — the “deserving poor” — the ceiling on what qualifying residents could earn was said to discourage hard work, acting as a sap on initiative and pluck. Ayn Rand’s “The Fountainhead” dramatized the backlash against Roosevelt’s call for a deeper social contract of shared responsibility: The hero of the 1943 novel is an architect of a public-housing complex who becomes enraged when he returns from a trip to discover that his bare-bones high-rise has been compromised to include “the expense of incomprehensible features” like balconies, a gymnasium, extra doorways and decorative brickwork. In an act portrayed as a valiant defense of his convictions, he dynamites the entire building. Maybe most telling, the same Depression-era legislation that funded the first public-housing complexes also created the federally insured private home loan. With this revolution in home financing, buyers were able to put down as little as 10 percent of a house’s cost and pay off their mortgages in small increments over an unprecedented 30 years. Even today, the federal government devotes three times as much each year to mortgage-interest deductions and other subsidies to the speculative real estate market — essentially public housing for homeowners — than to the entire annual budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n",
      "The first public-housing developments were often simple and unadorned brick rowhouses or duplexes. They were required to be built to minimum standards, so as not to compete with the private rental market, and the overall populations were diverse, in part because federal rules dictated that public housing couldn’t change the existing racial makeup of a neighborhood. In the 1950s, cities began to build massive complexes of clustered towers encircled by plots of land closed off to through streets. It was a purity of modernist city planning, influenced by the avant-garde “towers in the park” urban reimagining of the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. The density and nearly identical stripped-down designs of the high-rises were also believed to cut down on costs while meeting greater demand.\n",
      "“It’s almost like I died and went to heaven,” one of the first tenants of a development in Chicago recalled years later. J.S. Fuerst, the former head of research and statistics at the C.H.A., collected this testimonial and dozens of others like it from early occupants of the agency’s properties for a 2003 book titled “When Public Housing Was Paradise.” Even though these were low-income communities of thousands of people crammed together on isolated plazas, many families still found a modest home to be somehow divine after the damnation of the cold-water flats they left behind. There, they had been afraid of fires and sickness and eviction. Public housing, by contrast, was new and orderly. All the families went through a screening process. The buildings had teams of janitors on call around the clock. Groundskeepers maintained the gardens and lawns. There was a city agency responsible for answering calls. The C.H.A.’s first executive director, Elizabeth Wood, worried not that the new developments might be too large and come to define an area as low-rent, but rather that they wouldn’t be large enough to counteract the damaging effects of poverty and disrepair around them. “If it is not bold,” she said in 1945, “the result will be a series of small projects, islands in a wilderness of slums beaten down by smoke, noise and fumes.”\n",
      "Across the entire country, a majority of public housing remained in low-rises; there were eventually more than 3,000 local authorities, most with fewer than 500 units. But large housing “projects” came to dominate urban landscapes and symbolize for many the unruliness and otherness of the “inner city” in decline. The towers-in-the-park design was only ever partly to blame. In Chicago, as elsewhere, high-rise developments were built intentionally in neighborhoods that were already segregated racially; rather than apportioning the working poor across a number of areas and helping to diversify cities, public housing had the effect of solidifying racial and economic boundaries in superblocks detached from the street grid, in towers of concrete and steel. Yet they were also perennially underfunded and perilously mismanaged. The developments were allowed to deteriorate as maintenance and repairs lagged. And as the broader fortunes of cities declined — diminishing populations and disappearing jobs, spiking poverty and crime and drug use — public housing bore the worst of those effects.\n",
      "Soon, those same broad trends were used to justify abandoning the basic democratic idea of providing shelter for all. In 1972, when the 33 Pruitt-Igoe towers in St. Louis began to be imploded a mere 18 years after the complex fully opened, the televised image, with its mushrooming cloud of dust and debris, defined the popular notion of the public-housing experiment: It needed to be destroyed.\n",
      "For other cities, demolition still remained a political and practical impossibility. In previous decades when slums were cleared, those displaced were sent into public housing. Now where could tens of thousands of people from the projects be sent? But the aversion to social safety-net programs only came to root more deeply in the American mainstream. After retaking Congress in 1994, Republicans said they planned to scrap the federal housing agency entirely. President Clinton, promoting his cuts to the welfare system and proclaiming “the era of big government is over,” pre-emptively reorganized HUD. The agency promised to “infuse market discipline” into public housing. The anti-urban impulse that had sent middle-class families to the suburbs had reversed itself, and young professionals were flocking to city centers near their jobs and one another.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In 1990, Chicago’s population started to tick up for the first time in 40 years; the area surrounding Cabrini-Green added 4,000 white residents during the previous decade, and vacant lots that had sold for $30,000 a few years earlier were being snapped up for five times that amount. As the fortunes of cities changed once again, public housing experienced a new pressure. HUD began to award municipalities tens of millions of dollars in grants to tear down their public-housing high-rises and replace them with much smaller developments that mixed public-housing families with higher-income renters and market-rate owners. Proposals to preserve some of the towers, filling in the cleared land around them with a variety of housing types, were rejected. Many low-rise developments in rejuvenating areas were targeted as well. A majority of the relocated public-housing residents were given Section 8 vouchers to rent from landlords in the private market. Nationwide, 250,000 public-housing units have been demolished since the 1990s. Atlanta, Baltimore, Columbus, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Tucson — just about every American city got in on the action. But no city knocked down as many as Chicago.\n",
      "The C.H.A. moved Annie Ricks six miles away, to Chicago’s South Side, into Wentworth Gardens, a low-rise public-housing development built just after World War II. Since then, Wentworth had become sandwiched between the 14 lanes of the Dan Ryan Expressway and the parking lots for the White Sox baseball stadium. The only place nearby to buy groceries was a gas station and liquor store on the far end of the complex. But the units were modernized, and Ricks’s four-bedroom had a new kitchen and bathroom. Her apartment was on the second floor of a three-story walk-up, part of attached buildings that formed a horseshoe around a shared courtyard. In her living room, she hung photos of her family, three pictures of President Obama and a couple of prayers and rules: “Men don’t wear hats in the house.”\n",
      "Ricks wanted to remain upbeat about the move. But when violence broke out at her new home, the longtime Wentworth residents said it was the fault of the newcomers, the outsiders from Cabrini-Green, a number of whom had been moved there. An elderly woman announced for Rose to hear that she didn’t like the Cabrini people and wanted them gone. When Reggie and Raqkown tried to play basketball at the courts beside their apartment, the guys there threw elbows and fists, trying to turn the game into a brawl. A group of boys jumped Reggie in the courtyard. Other former Cabrini residents who ended up there had guns pulled on them. “People at Wentworth think you’re stepping on their turf,” Ricks said. “This is not your turf. This is C.H.A.’s turf. You can’t run me from my home. Because I do pay rent.”\n",
      "She often made the trip to visit her friends at the remaining strip of rowhouses at Cabrini-Green. She went to the jazz concerts held in the nearby park. Like many relocated families, she felt safer in the vestiges of the old neighborhood. When Raqkown, Ricks’s youngest, left his high school most days, he traveled to the field house at Cabrini. The principal at the neighborhood elementary school said two-thirds of his students were former Cabrini families who took the bus and train long distances to get there. Several Cabrini-Green Facebook pages formed, people reporting job opportunities and business ventures, sharing words of inspiration and announcements of deaths in the Cabrini family. Oftentimes a post showed a photo of one of the disappeared high-rises — “Who can say what building this is?” — leading to long threads of competing memories.\n",
      "On an airless Saturday night in the summer of 2012, Ricks stepped outside into the Wentworth courtyard. She’d been confined to her apartment all day taking care of grandchildren and wanted to relax. She set up a small table, placing atop it a transistor radio and a can of bug spray. She popped open a bottle of iced tea she bought at the gas station and tuned the radio to a gospel station. Then she was startled by screaming in the distance. She recognized the voice before she saw him: Reggie. He came racing toward her out of the darkness with Raqkown sprinting beside him. A mob of men were at their heels. Her sons dashed past her and up the stairs to their apartment, their pursuers rushing past as well. Rose, who was inside, opened the door for her brothers, and the Wentworth guys charged in behind them, colliding into her. Ricks ran up the stairs after them. “Home invasion!” she cried.\n",
      "In the cramped apartment, one invader knocked a television off the wall and stomped his foot through it. They pushed over a chest of drawers and threw chairs. Reggie, who was bleeding from his head, lifted a cooking pot off the stove and swung it to fend off blows. Rose armed herself with a mop. Their mother usually carried a fist of keys with her, and she now punched with it. She held the aerosol can of bug repellent as well, and she sprayed it into any face close by. “I’m just going to say it like this,” Ricks said later that night, “we did whatever we had to do to get their asses out of our house.”\n",
      "For the next two weeks, Ricks stayed with a son in the Cabrini rowhouses. One of her older daughters put up Reggie and Raqkown. Rose moved in temporarily with another sibling in the western suburbs. A social-service provider asked Ricks if she wanted to go to a shelter. She didn’t. A shelter wasn’t any place to live. “That’s like giving up,” Ricks said. With the home invasion, her old stubbornness returned. No way was she going to be cheated out of a four-bedroom again. Not this time. She was going to keep her family together.\n",
      "She put in for a transfer to a different C.H.A. development along the lakefront, and she documented every time she phoned the agency to get an update. She checked in with a pro bono lawyer who agreed to take her case, asking when she should expect to move.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“Just trying to get them to confirm that you’re eligible to be on the wait list for a four-bedroom,” he told her.\n",

      "“I wish I knew. I think they’ll respond to me. I’ll bother them until they do. I think this is going to be taken care of. It’s not going to be done quickly.”\n",
      "“It should be quickly, because you’re my lawyer,” Ricks said.\n",
      "“I may be a lawyer; however, I’m not a magician.”\n",
      "She ended up cutting ties with him. He’d been emailing the C.H.A. since July, but three months later, her situation remained the same. “I’m not prejudiced,” she said. “But if I’d have been white, he’d have moved me the very same day. He doesn’t have to live in Wentworth Gardens, in the ghetto, as they say.”\n",
      "Across the highway from Wentworth Gardens, the 28 towers of the Robert Taylor Homes had stretched in a narrow band for two miles, looming in groups of three like sentinels for almost 50 years. But the entire housing project was torn down by 2007. The cleared land remained vacant. Unlike the Cabrini-Green site, the area couldn’t attract the higher rents or the sale of market-rate apartments to support a new mixed-income development. Mixed-income replacement buildings did offer public-housing families a better place to live. But the restrictions on entry excluded many, and interactions within the buildings were often tense. Most of all, the blended populations and low densities (as well as the crash of the housing market, which put a halt to most construction) meant they met just a small percentage of the need. In Chicago today, fewer than 3,000 public-housing families live in one of the mixed-income complexes.\n",
      "Many more families were like the Rickses, people who went from run-down public housing to rehabbed public housing, albeit still in areas of concentrated poverty. The same proved true for those who moved with a voucher. The C.H.A. currently oversees 16,000 units of occupied public housing, more than a third of which are designated for the elderly, and 47,000 vouchers in the private market. The combination of the two exceeds what the agency’s total supply of housing was in the ’90s. Nationally, the number of families using a Section 8 rent subsidy has doubled over the last 25 years, to 2.3 million. In theory, a voucher gives a family the choice to live anywhere. But the rents the federal government pays to Section 8 landlords are generally not enough for a home in a diverse neighborhood with strong schools and low crime; most landlords taking vouchers aren’t in “opportunity” areas but in poor and racially isolated ones not so different from the razed government-run high-rises. In 2003, an independent monitor of the C.H.A.’s first years of relocations offered a bleak assessment: “The result has been that the vertical ghettos from which the families are being moved are being replaced with horizontal ghettos, located in well defined, highly segregated neighborhoods.”\n",
      "The families that were dispersed from Chicago’s demolished public housing have been blamed for the city’s recent surge in gun violence, as well as for crime in the suburbs, the greater Midwest and even parts of the South. Several studies have shown that C.H.A. residents did not spread disorder wherever they settled, as if they carried an infectious disease. But these families were moved primarily to areas of Chicago that were already hollowed out of population, schools, occupied homes, jobs and resources. In South Shore, which took on more Section 8 renters than any other neighborhood in the city, 3,700 apartments were caught up in foreclosures, one out of every five rental units. The problems of concentrated poverty and isolation, which the demolitions were supposed to solve, persisted — and relocated families now found themselves in strange territory without their former support networks. People in public housing had, by necessity, bartered services, shopped together, shared food, stepped up when a neighbor lost a loved one. Annie Ricks’s oldest daughter, Kenosha, left Cabrini-Green when she was in her 20s and moved with her family to a block on the West Side. “I’ve been out here almost a decade, and I know three or four of my neighbors,” she told me recently. “ ‘They from the projects,’ people say. But they don’t know me. They weren’t raised how we were raised. We were raised to stick together. If you’re a neighbor, you let the next neighbor know what’s going on. They don’t do that out here.”\n",
      "Developments like Cabrini-Green did in fact need to be made safer and more livable, and maybe even torn down. But the public had an obligation as well to ensure that those who lived there didn’t lose out when the high-rises were replaced. Virtually no new public housing has been built in the country in decades. There’s still a stock of over a million units nationwide, down from a peak of 1.4 million. Much of it is at risk. A HUD-commissioned study in 2010 found a $26 billion backlog in repair and maintenance needs, a figure estimated to have ballooned since then to more than $50 billion. Each year, some 10,000 to 15,000 units are lost solely because of neglect. The New York City Housing Authority had long avoided the failings that troubled authorities in other big cities. Towers in New York are the norm; maintenance and management remained strong, and high demand for housing allowed for renters with a greater range of incomes. But the city’s 2,500 buildings, home to 400,000 New Yorkers, now need $17 billion in unmet repairs. The problem is often worse in small cities and less-urban areas, because there is no other supply of low-income rentals once dilapidated public housing is shuttered. HUD, rather than trying to replenish its dangerously insufficient capital fund, submitted a 2018 budget that would slash it by another two-thirds.\n",
      "All of this comes amid an affordable-housing crisis that is as urgent as it is unheeded. Today, only one of every five families poor enough to qualify for a housing subsidy actually receives one. A quarter of all renters nationwide pay more than half their income in rent. Families are forced to make harmful choices between rent and food, doctor’s visits and education costs. In their search for what public-housing agencies had promised as the minimal requirement of a “decent, safe and sanitary home,” the poor have been pushed farther from the economic activity and opportunities of city centers. The current head of the Chicago Housing Authority, Eugene Jones Jr., has envisioned a remedy, albeit an unlikely one, coming in the form of an infrastructure bill that would fully fund housing assistance, coupling the subsidy with the wraparound services — health care, day care, job training and transportation — that residents need to thrive. “I’m not a Republican, but we’re trying to transform our residents out of public and assisted housing,” Jones said. “The end game is that you’re moving off subsistence.” It’s a noble goal. But there simply is no adequate supply of housing at that next step up. In 2014, when the C.H.A. opened a lottery just to make it onto the waiting list for either a voucher or public-housing unit, 280,000 families entered their names, a quarter of all the households in Chicago.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Around the old Cabrini-Green and other expensive urban real estate markets, close-cropped towers are again being built. These are high-end private developments, although they occasionally set aside a number of subsidized apartments for an allotted period of time in exchange for tax breaks and building rights. The common sentiment is that the people who can afford the luxury high-rises have created their own good fortune; the generous government benefits they receive are rightfully earned. For those in Wentworth Gardens or Chicago’s distant South Side or any impoverished neighborhood in the country, no political will exists anymore for the government to step in and transform the blocks that have been left to decline. Affordable-housing advocates are by no means pushing for a return to large public-housing high-rise developments, but some have noted that a few towers mixed in here and there with the luxury condos wouldn’t stand out.\n",
      "There are calls to again mobilize the country’s resources. The Bipartisan Policy Center has endorsed a universal voucher program that would guarantee rental assistance to the country’s 11.4 million extremely low income households. Several studies by the Urban Institute and other research organizations show that such an endeavor would recoup much of its cost in reduced homelessness and also ease health problems and other consequences of instability that are ultimately paid for by governments. Several organizations in recent years have proposed tax credits for cost-burdened low-income households. And a bill introduced numerous times by the Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison sets out to cut the mortgage-interest deduction for wealthier homeowners and use the $200 billion in savings over 10 years to close the affordable-housing deficit. Congress did, in fact, cut the mortgage-interest deduction as part of last December’s tax bill, though by much less than low-income housing proponents had wanted. The savings went not to creating affordable housing but to offsetting the tax benefits that Republicans doled out to corporations and the wealthiest Americans. Seventy years into our test as a country to provide housing for those who have too little, we are hardly any closer to passing.\n",
      "Annie Ricks was out walking one night, venturing from Wentworth Gardens, when a burning pain shot through her left foot. She soon developed calluses on her heel. Then she couldn’t put any weight on the foot. An emergency-room doctor said she had diabetes and needed surgery. The recovery was supposed to take less than a week, but Ricks got an infection at the hospital. She had trouble eating and lost weight, the sharp bones of her cheeks never more pronounced. “I need to laugh sometimes instead of cry,” she said. “If I’m going to cry, it won’t get me out of Wentworth Gardens.” But then she came down with pneumonia. She was relocated to another hospital and intubated. She couldn’t talk or smile. Her daughters complained that the staff ignored their mother because she lacked insurance and relied on state medical assistance. They said the nurses failed to turn her properly, pointing to the holes forming in their mother’s back. The family contacted a malpractice lawyer they heard about on television, who asked them repeatedly if there had been a bed fall, because that would be a “slam dunk.” No, they told him, there hadn’t been a fall, and he stopped returning their calls. Then on Nov. 16, 2014, with her family gathered around, Annie Ricks died. She was 58. “You walk in with a sore foot, and you never leave,” a daughter said bitterly.\n",
      "Rose and her toddler daughter remained in the apartment at Wentworth Gardens. Her brothers slept there less and less frequently. With their mother gone, their lives became more itinerant. They stayed with girlfriends or with other siblings scattered around the city and the surrounding suburbs. Wentworth hadn’t become any safer for them. Reggie, in his early 20s, was arrested there after another fight. A group of guys at the development pounced on Raqkown and broke a bone in his neck. But it wasn’t clear where they would be better off. Raequonn Ricks Williams, a 19-year-old relative, was shot on the West Side, one of the 762 people murdered in Chicago in 2016. Reggie and his mother had squabbled before her death. He’d been turned down at more than a dozen job interviews, and Annie Ricks berated him for giving up. He racked up arrests. “When Reggie left Cabrini, he felt his whole family was gone,” Kenosha said of her younger brother. “His immediate family plus everybody he was in, like, preschool with.”\n",
      "Rose left finally for an apartment building 25 blocks farther south. She had got her daughter into a school near there, and she had also come to feel haunted at Wentworth, always expecting to see her mother emerge from one of the bedrooms. Back in 2014, at her mother’s funeral, Rose had been unable to speak through her tears. A hundred former Cabrini-Green residents showed up at the West Side church to pay their respects. Rose’s siblings talked about their mother’s stubbornness, her determination to provide for them: “What she didn’t have, she made sure we had it,” one said. Reggie said he didn’t care that he had a terrible singing voice, and he started in on an R. Kelly song: “Dear Mama, you wouldn’t believe what I’m goin’ through/But still I got my head up just like I promised you.” Kenton, Ricks’s fourth of nine sons, said they all learned from her example. “Be strong, take care of the kids, take care of family,” he repeated. She made them all better people. “She’d do anything for anybody,” he said. “She was just love.”\n",

      "By Thomas P. Abt\n",
      "This week the F.B.I. released its annual tally of crime in the United States, and the picture it paints is troubling. In 2016, there were 17,250 homicides, an increase of more than 8.5 percent from the previous year. This comes on the heels of a 12 percent rise in 2015, bringing the total increase over two years to nearly 22 percent — the largest two-year increase in homicide in 25 years.\n",
      "Violent crime — which includes rapes, robberies and assaults, in addition to homicides — is also up, but less so, rising 4 percent, after a 4 percent increase in 2015.\n",
      "What to make of this two-year spike in death and violence is unclear, but you can be certain of this: Partisans on all sides will seek to spin this situation to their advantage. And that’s a problem that stunts productive conversation about solutions.\n",
      "Criminal justice reformers will worry that fear of violent crime could slow the momentum of their movement. As a result, they’ll play down the data that says it’s increasing. They’ll say that it’s too soon to call this a trend, that a few neighborhoods in a few cities are driving the numbers, and remind us that overall rates of violence remain near historical lows.\n",
      "Opponents of true reform, including President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, will do far worse. They will likely use the latest numbers to push the culture-war-fueling narrative about “American carnage” that Mr. Trump described in his Inaugural Address. They’ll double down on outdated tough-on-crime strategies like aggressive prosecutions, mandatory minimum sentencing and drug education and follow a strategy that my colleague David Kennedy, a criminal justice researcher and director of the National Network for Safe Communities, recently called a “criminologist’s nightmare.\n",
      "And then nothing will change. When it comes to how the country deals with crime, impasse and stalemate will win the day.\n",
      "This is not new: Progressives consistently argue that crime is simply the result of socioeconomic root causes such as poverty, unemployment, and poor education. But the fact that crime rates declined during the Great Depression and remained low during the Great Recession indicate that’s not the case — in reality, crime rates often rise and fall independently of such measures. Conservatives often assert that crime is a matter of values, even though research shows that most people living in dangerous neighborhoods despise the violence they see in their communities.\n",
      "For years, some scholars claimed that mass incarceration was caused by the war on drugs, but it was the aggressive punishment of violence, not drugs, that pushed our incarceration rates sky high. Law-and-order relics link drug use and violence. But today’s drug epidemic, the opioid crisis, took hold years before the rise in violent crime and has few proven connections with violence to date.\n",
      "Many argue that guns are the crux of that problem, so they push for legal restrictions on them. Most gun crimes, however, are perpetrated with weapons that are already illegally possessed under the laws on the books today. Others insist that guns are the solution, as they could allow law-abiding people to protect themselves from crime — even though states with permissive gun laws tend to have higher rates of gun violence, and that households with guns are more, not less, likely to suffer gun injuries.\n",
      "We need a new national dialogue on crime, one that is less about ideology and more about evidence. The current conversation oversimplifies complex issues, emphasizes blame over responsibility, and encourages deadlock instead of progress. We need to move from argument winning to problem solving, recognizing that all these issues are related to one another, and especially to the violence that needlessly claims so many lives.\n",
      "The conventional wisdom tells us if we want to reduce violent crime, we should look elsewhere: to poverty, culture, drugs or guns. Decades of data says otherwise: When a colleague and I surveyed over 1,400 studies on anti-violence efforts, we learned that to control violence, one must account for it directly by focusing on the small numbers of places, people and behaviors that disproportionately drive the problem. The best approach is to tackle the hardest cases with a combination of empathy and resolve, offering assistance if it will be accepted but also accountability for brutal behavior.\n",
      "Here’s a proven approach that deserves more support: Mr. Kennedy’s National Network for Safe Communities supports local efforts to reduce violence, minimize incarceration, and improve police-community relationships. Civic, community and criminal justice leaders confront criminals with a simple message: “The killing must end now. If you let us, we will help you. If you make us, we will stop you.” Those willing to turn away from violence are offered services and support, while those who will not are confronted with coordinated law enforcement action. A systematic review found that this strategy reduced crime and violence in nine out of 10 studies, with homicide reductions of 34 percent to 63 percent.\n",
      "Let’s not deny or diminish the immense suffering of victims of crime and communities that are plagued by violence. And let’s refuse to exploit that suffering by using it to sow fear among Americans. Setting aside the politics will give us the best chance to stop the senseless killing in our country.\n",

      "Most theories for the great crime decline that swept across nearly every major American city over the last 25 years have focused on the would-be criminals.\n",
      "Their lives changed in many ways starting in the 1990s: Strict new policing tactics kept closer watch on them. Mass incarceration locked them up in growing numbers. The crack epidemic that ensnared many began to recede. Even the more unorthodox theories — around the rise of abortion, the reduction in lead or the spread of A.D.H.D. medication — have argued that larger shifts in society altered the behavior (and existence) of potential criminals.\n",
      "But none of these explanations have paid much attention to the communities where violence plummeted the most. New research suggests that people there were working hard, with little credit, to address the problem themselves.\n",
      "Local nonprofit groups that responded to the violence by cleaning streets, building playgrounds, mentoring children and employing young men had a real effect on the crime rate. That’s what Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University, argues in a new study and a forthcoming book. Mr. Sharkey doesn’t contend that community groups alone drove the national decline in crime, but rather that their impact is a major missing piece.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“This was a part that has been completely overlooked and ignored in national debates over the crime drop,” he said. “But I think it’s fundamental to what happened.”\n",
      "Between the early 1990s and 2015, the homicide rate in America fell by half. Rates of robbery, assault and theft tumbled in tandem. In New York, Washington and San Diego, murders dropped by more than 75 percent. Although violence has increased over the last two years in some cities, including Chicago and Baltimore, even those places remain safer than they were 25 years ago. And crime has continued to fall in other cities, most notably New York, where shootings are at a record low.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "This long-term trend has fundamentally altered city life. It has transformed fear-inducing parks and subways into vibrant public spaces. It has lured wealthier whites back into cities. It has raised the life expectancies of black men. And even in an age of widening urban inequality, it has meant that the daily lives of the most disadvantaged are less dangerous now than they were a generation ago. These poor neighborhoods, Mr. Sharkey has found, have been the greatest beneficiaries of this tectonic change in safety.\n",
      "The same communities were participating in another big shift that started in the 1990s: The number of nonprofits began to rise sharply across the country, particularly those addressing neighborhood and youth development.\n",
      "Mr. Sharkey and the doctoral students Gerard Torrats-Espinosa and Delaram Takyar used data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics to track the rise of nonprofits in 264 cities across more than 20 years. Nonprofits were more likely to form in the communities with the gravest problems. But they also sprang up for reasons that had little to do with local crime trends, such as an expansion in philanthropic funding. A spike in nonprofits addressing subjects like the arts and medical research occurred in this same era.\n",
      "Comparing the growth of other kinds of nonprofits, the researchers believe they were able to identify the causal effect of these community groups: Every 10 additional organizations in a city with 100,000 residents, they estimate, led to a 9 percent drop in the murder rate and a 6 percent drop in violent crime.\n",
      "In a criminology field that has produced some eyebrow-raising ideas, this one is actually not so surprising. That national finding echoes local studies of some individual programs, like one run by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society that converts abandoned lots into green spaces and that has been linked in Philadelphia to reduced gun violence.\n",
      "The research also affirms some of the tenets of community policing: that neighborhoods are vital to policing themselves, and that they can address the complex roots of violence in ways that fall beyond traditional police work.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“It’s absolutely consistent with what I would argue is probably the prevalent theory of policing among the major cities today,” Richard Myers, the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said of the new research.\n",
      "Local organizations also say Mr. Sharkey’s results validate what they have already witnessed.\n",
      "“Any time people’s basic needs are met, violence goes down — that’s not new,” said Noreen McClendon, who directs the nonprofit Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles.\n",
      "The group, led by Ms. McClendon’s mother for many years, was formed in the 1980s to fight a proposed waste incinerator in the neighborhood. It evolved in the 1990s to address many of the neighborhood’s other challenges. The group created dozens of block clubs to care for individual streets. It cleaned alleys and repaired potholes, and hired local ex-offenders to do that work. It established a credit union, sponsored a jazz festival and developed hundreds of units of affordable housing.\n",
      "During a time of major disinvestment in cities, and severe cuts in federal support for urban programs, residents of the neighborhood believed no one else was coming to help. “Nobody,” Ms. McClendon said. And if the group had not done this work itself? “There would have been a lot more death,” she said, “between violence amongst people, violence from police brutality, just drugs.”\n",
      "Many similar groups did not explicitly think of what they were doing as violence prevention. But in creating playgrounds, they enabled parents to better monitor their children. In connecting neighbors, they improved the capacity of residents to control their streets. In forming after-school programs, they offered alternatives to crime.\n",
      "In the East Lake neighborhood of Atlanta, the crime rate in the mid 1990s was 18 times the national average. The drug market in the neighborhood was estimated to be doing $35 million in business a year. There hadn’t been a new building permit issued in the neighborhood in nearly three decades, a sign of how little anyone had invested in the community other than to buy drugs there.\n",

      "Then the newly formed East Lake Foundation developed new mixed-income housing to replace a decaying public housing project. It started a golf program for neighborhood children on a nearby but long-deteriorating golf course. The foundation eventually opened a charter school, where the first class of seniors had a 100 percent graduation rate in May.\n",
      "“We knew we wanted to see violence and crime go down in the community,” said Carol Naughton, who led the foundation for years and today is the president of a national group, Purpose Built Communities, that is trying to teach East Lake’s model in other cities. “But we’ve never had a crime-prevention program.”\n",
      "Today violent crime in East Lake is down 90 percent from 1995. But Ms. Naughton is momentarily perplexed by the question of whether she believes groups like hers have gotten enough credit for contributing to that outcome.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“We’re not part of the crime-reduction world, or the public safety world, in the same way that we’re part of the health and education and housing world,” she said. “It never occurred to us that we’re not getting the credit, because we don’t even know that world is out there.”\n",
      "The lesson in that response, and in Mr. Sharkey’s work — that effective crime prevention doesn’t necessarily look like stop-and-frisk, or hot-spot policing, or mass incarceration — is particularly relevant today as cities rethink policing.\n",
      "“A lot of these communities were in despair because they needed resources,” said Robert Sampson, a sociologist at Harvard who has studied Chicago neighborhoods damaged by violence. “And what did they get? Well, they mainly got crime control. They got increases in incarceration.”\n",
      "Those tactics may have contributed to the decline in crime as well. But they’ve come with costs that have become clearer over time, in antagonizing communities and disrupting families.\n",
      "Mr. Sharkey is pointing to one possible solution with less evident downsides. And he’s suggesting that communities can effectively take on the very roles that the police say have strained them as they’ve increasingly been asked to perform jobs they weren’t trained for, as guidance counselors or marriage therapists or substance-abuse experts.\n",
      "“They are taking that burden away from the police that probably never should have been there, but by default has kind of landed there,” said Mr. Myers of the chiefs association, who is also a former longtime police chief himself, in Michigan, Virginia, Colorado and elsewhere.\n",
      "As Mr. Sharkey publishes his findings, crime rates are now diverging after a generation in which violence fell reliably year after year nearly everywhere. It’s not clear yet whether the great crime decline he writes about will continue. But he argues that it’s time for a new model of violence prevention, one that relies more heavily on the kind of work that these community groups have been quietly doing than on the aggressive police tactics and tough sentencing that the Trump administration now advocates.\n",
      "“The model that we’ve relied on to control violence for a long time has broken down,” Mr. Sharkey said. If communities want police to step back, he is pointing to some of the people who can step in. “This gives us a model. It gives us another set of actors who can play a larger role.”\n",

      "Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to flood the streets of central Brooklyn over Labor Day weekend for the J’ouvert parade, a daybreak celebration that marks the start of Carnival in Caribbean cultures.\n",
      "On Monday, as part of an effort to make the event safer, officials detailed new security measures for J’ouvert, drawing on the city’s experiences in Times Square on New Year’s Eve.\n",
      "The parade on Sept. 4 is one of the city’s largest cultural celebrations, and officials had already decided that it would start this year at 6 a.m. instead of 4 a.m., after deadly violence in recent years prompted calls to alter the celebration or shut it down completely.\n",
      "For the first time, the parade formation area and two-mile route will be closed to the public beginning at 11 the night before it begins. To enter, people will have to pass through metal detectors at one of 12 checkpoints along the route, where they will be screened for prohibited items.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“Exactly like New Year’s Eve,” the Police Department’s chief of patrol, Terence A. Monahan, said at a news conference Monday with Mayor Bill de Blasio at the Brooklyn Public Library. “No large bags, no backpacks. Any alcohol will be confiscated, and obviously if you’re going in with a gun or firearm, you’re going to be arrested.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The J’ouvert parade forms on Flatbush Avenue between Grand Army Plaza and Empire Boulevard. This year, the bands will head south on Flatbush Avenue through Prospect Park, turn east on Empire Boulevard, then south on Nostrand Avenue before the parade ends at Midwood Street.\n",
      "Outreach workers trained to defuse tensions before they escalate to violence will be looking for signs of trouble, and more than 3,000 police officers will patrol the parade route and surrounding area. Around 350 towering floodlights and about 100 high-resolution surveillance cameras will help them see.\n",
      "While most people attending J’ouvert come to peacefully celebrate Caribbean culture, the mayor said, “We have known in the past there have been some bad apples and some people who have caused real pain and real damage. Our message today is that this will not be tolerated.”\n",
      "Traditionally, the crowds of people who attend J’ouvert, a warm-up to the West Indian American Day Parade, begin gathering in the early morning hours of Labor Day. In costumes, clouds of powder and splashes of paint, they dance to Soca music blaring from portable speakers.\n",

      "But in recent years, the festive atmosphere has attracted people looking to settle disputes under the cover of darkness and in the thickness of the crowds.\n",
      "Four people were shot during the festival last year, and two, Tyreke Borel, 17, and Tiarah Poyau, 22, were killed. In 2015, Carey W. Gabay, 43, a lawyer in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s administration, and Denentro Josiah, 24, were fatally wounded during the celebration.\n",
      "Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, said the announcement on Monday followed a weekend in which 20 people had been shot across the city.\n",
      "Councilman Jumaane D. Williams said the tally was a grim reminder of the gun violence neighborhoods were dealing with throughout the year, and he said the security plan helped to combat a perception that the residents did not want to do anything to help stop it.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“We all want to,” he said, adding that it was also important to make changes that would do more than just make people feel good. “We want to save lives.”\n",
      "Margaret Peters, 73, an immigrant from Trinidad and Tobago, was wounded during J’ouvert last year when a bullet struck her left arm and right hand. In an interview, she said the new security plan was “a very good idea” and advised people not to allow the small risk of violence to keep them away from the celebration.\n",
      "“Just go out and enjoy yourself,” she said, “and hope to God you’ll be safe.”\n",

      "The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work.\n",
      "When we solicited questions last month for our new publisher, A. G. Sulzberger, our readers responded in droves — to the tune of some 2,500 submissions. You’ll find his responses to a curated selection below. (Some questions have been condensed and edited for clarity.)\n",
      "_____\n",
      "Before I answer your questions, I want to share a bit about my background.\n",
      "I got my start as a reporter at newspapers in Rhode Island and Oregon before joining The New York Times as a metro reporter in 2009. I went on to cover the Midwest as Kansas City bureau chief, where I wrote about crime, government and many tornadoes and floods.\n",
      "But my favorite stories were the ones that were built around memorable characters or that came out of discovering something unexpected: a look at the 103-year-old federal judge who took the notion of lifetime appointments to the extreme; the strange saga of one of England’s most infamous bank robbers; an examination of how the internet weaponized small-town gossip; a story about how a community in rural Kansas became the last place on earth to develop Kodachrome film (which was turned into a movie last year).\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Most recently, while working as an editor, I wrote this 7,000-word tale about two hang glider pilots battling to set the world record for longest flight.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In 2013, my work shifted to helping craft the strategy for The Times as a whole, after I led a team that produced a report calling on the newsroom to accelerate our digital transformation.\n",
      "Since then, I’ve been working with colleagues across the company to answer an essential question: How can The Times hold on to the best of our journalistic traditions while also evolving to meet the changing needs of our readers and taking advantage of powerful new ways to find and tell stories? Though we’ve made a lot of progress in the last couple of years, that question remains a focus in my new role as publisher.\n",
      "And now for the questions …\n",
      "_____\n",
      "What exactly is the role of a newspaper publisher?— Long, in San Antonio\n",
      "Seems like a good question to kick this off.\n",
      "At the highest level, a publisher oversees a news organization’s journalism and business operations. This means I am responsible for ensuring that our journalism is worth your time and money, and that we have a strong strategy for our long-term commercial success in a moment of pressure and change in our industry.\n",
      "But to me, Adolph Ochs, my great-great-grandfather and our first publisher, captured the spirit of the role best: “To maintain the editorial independence and the integrity of The New York Times and to continue it as an independent newspaper, entirely fearless, free of ulterior influence and unselfishly devoted to the public welfare.”\n",
      "_____\n",
      "How do you win the battle with “fake news” and reach those who believe The New York Times is biased?— Cristina Chan, in San Francisco\n",
      "This is a really important — and tricky — question, and one that I think about a lot.\n",
      "Powerful forces are stoking distrust in the news media with attacks on the press and sowing confusion by promoting clickbait, rumor, fraudulent stories and propaganda. This has been driven in no small part by various politicians and technology platforms pursuing their short-term interests over the greater good. These tactics contribute to growing polarization and undermine trust in news organizations.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "It will be hard for a single institution to counteract these forces, but we’re determined to try. (I’m encouraged that some leaders in Washington and Silicon Valley seem to be recognizing that they need to do their part.)\n",
      "The best thing we at The Times can do is stay true to our mission of finding and telling the stories that matter, without fear or favor. I believe that our rapidly growing number of readers and subscribers is a testament to how people increasingly crave news they can trust. I also believe we still have more to do to help people understand why they should trust our journalism and to provide greater transparency into our reporting.\n",
      "In the past, our approach was to let our work speak for itself. Our assumption was that people intuitively understood all the hard work that goes into a New York Times article. But we’ve learned we need to do more to explain how our reporting works. For example, many readers don’t know that a dateline from a foreign city means our reporters are physically in that place, on the ground seeing and hearing firsthand everything they’re reporting. They don’t know that Adam Liptak’s Supreme Court reporting is made stronger by his experience as a lawyer, or that Sheri Fink’s background as a physician informs her investigations into medical misconduct. And they don’t know that for every person we quote in a story, sometimes dozens more have been interviewed.\n",
      "On the flip side, I look at articles like Ellen Barry’s heartbreaking tale of a woman murdered in India, C. J. Chivers’s deeply empathetic examination of a Marine’s unraveling after returning from war, or the investigation Malachy Browne led into how Americans were attacked by a foreign leader’s security detail — all are great examples of the balance between classic journalistic storytelling and sharing helpful context about how we actually found and reported that story. (And it should be no surprise that when we do this well, it has a real, meaningful impact.)\n",
      "The more we can show readers the thoughtfulness, thoroughness, expertise and rigor that go into everything we cover, the better. (I address the concern about bias in more detail below.)\n",
      "_____\n",
      "How can ordinary people help support The New York Times’s important work?— Margo Wixsom, in Inverness, Calif.\n",
      "Unlike most news organizations, The Times gets the majority of its revenue directly from readers like you. So the best way to support our work is by subscribing — and by encouraging your friends and family to do the same. If you’re feeling extra generous, you can buy a gift subscription or sponsor student subscriptions to help the next generation learn the value of engaging with the world through quality journalism.\n",
      "But I’d also encourage everyone who is able to support your local news organizations as well. They do essential work and are feeling real pressure right now.\n",

      "Will you bring back the position of public editor? Eliminating that position decreases your responsibility to the public for accuracy and fairness.— Paul Kingsley, in Rochester\n",
      "Our responsibility to ensure the accuracy and fairness of our work will never change. As I said in my note to readers this month, your trust is the most important asset we have.\n",
      "So why eliminate the role of public editor?\n",
      "The public editor was created in a different era to act as an intermediary between our readers and our journalists. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t. But today there are faster, more effective and more transparent ways to receive and respond to feedback.\n",
      "My view is that if readers have significant concerns about a particular story or how we’ve covered a broader topic, we should engage with them directly and openly.\n",
      "That’s part of the reason we introduced the Reader Center and why we’re doing things like this Q. and A. In the old model, the public editor would have sat down with the new publisher, asked a few questions of her choosing and written a short article based on my responses. In the new model, I’m hearing your questions directly and you’re hearing my answers directly. (As part of this process, every question submitted by readers was reviewed by editors, who selected those that captured the most common areas of interest and concern.)\n",
      "If you’re worried that The Times no longer faces real scrutiny, check out the president’s tweets. In all seriousness, our work is even more closely watched and there are more ways to raise questions and concerns than ever before. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have given readers the ability to immediately raise questions and concerns, as has our comments section. Just as important, we’re covered every day by other news organizations around the world. And we are one of the few places anywhere to still have a significant, full-time operation dedicated to editorial standards, reader complaints and corrections.\n",

      "As one of the few papers with national clout left, how will The New York Times work to improve the coverage of the rest of the country?— Matt, in Michigan\n",
      "This is a great question.\n",
      "I got my start at local newspapers like The Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, Calif.; The Providence Journal in Rhode Island; and The Oregonian. I know firsthand that local newsrooms play an essential role in providing the information and insights that bind a community together, and the accountability that prevents leaders from abusing their power.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But the pressures local newsrooms face are immense. The number of working journalists in this country has declined by more than half since 2000, and those who remain are increasingly concentrated in a few places like New York, Washington and California. These trends carry profound risks for our democracy.\n",
      "Though there are no easy answers, The Times is deeply committed to finding ways to support robust coverage throughout the United States.\n",
      "The most concrete evidence of this commitment is our decision to expand our national reporting staff. We now have journalists living in every part of the country who spend their time crisscrossing their states and regions for stories that aren’t being told. (As I mentioned above, I had the great fortune of doing one of these jobs myself as a correspondent based in the Kansas City bureau — though being a vegetarian there admittedly had its challenges.)\n",
      "We’re also looking for ways to support local journalism. One example is our partnerships with local news organizations like The Times-Picayune in New Orleans. But there is much more to do and we’re actively thinking about other ways to contribute.\n",
      "_____\n",
      "How do you respond to the view that The New York Times has a liberal bias?— Ron Caton, in Alamo, Calif.\n",
      "There is nothing we take more seriously than the fairness, accuracy and independence of our journalism.\n",
      "That’s not to say our journalists never have opinions. But just as a judge is expected to set aside personal views to ensure the integrity of a trial, our journalists are expected to do the same to ensure the integrity of their journalism. My colleagues in the newsroom work hard at this, and it’s one of the reasons The Times has such strict standards and rigorous editing.\n",
      "Our job is to follow the truth, wherever it leads, and to bring information to light — not to tell people how to think.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Now more than ever, it is vital for our pages to feature stories and columns that reflect a diversity of views and that challenge readers to consider perspectives very different from their own. Making sure our report explores multiple angles on the biggest stories is a critical part of our mission to remain nonpartisan in these polarized times.\n",
      "Do we sometimes fall short? Of course. This is a human enterprise. But I think some complaints about bias — both from the right and the left — are rooted in a misunderstanding of our core journalistic role. And some complaints, more cynically, simply seek to discredit reporting that may prove unflattering or damaging to certain interests.\n",
      "Our commitment to independent, unbiased journalism is one of the things that makes The Times special. As publisher, I’m determined to maintain this approach, and I know our journalists embrace that responsibility with a fierce sense of purpose.\n",
      "_____\n",
      "After the 2016 election, I canceled my 15-year-old New York Times subscription. I would like to come back, but I need some sort of accounting for your editorial decisions during the 2016 election.\n",
      "In particular, your coverage of the Clinton email scandal and Trump-Russia seems inexplicable in hindsight. I get that you assumed Clinton would win, but the race was always pretty close. Meanwhile, obvious stories, like Trump’s business connections abroad, were totally ignored.\n",
      "The overall tone of the coverage seems inexplicable. Some sort of context for these decisions is needed in order to rebuild my loss of trust in your judgment about what to maximize and what to leave out.— Heather, in New York City\n",
      "I hear you, and I’ve heard from others who were upset, too. And I don’t want to in any way diminish that concern, but I do want to put it into a broader context.\n",
      "It’s impossible to have aggressive, skeptical coverage of candidates for public office without upsetting some of their supporters. Hillary Clinton was upset with our coverage. So were Bernie Sanders and a host of Republican candidates, from Marco Rubio to Ted Cruz. Then there is Donald J. Trump, who has had, as you may have noticed, pretty unending complaints of his own.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "No news organization reported more aggressively and deeply on Mr. Trump during the campaign than The Times. We broke stories about his personal finances, his treatment of women, his record of not telling the truth, his business ties with questionable foreign interests and much more. Our coverage of Russia’s attempts to interfere in the election was part of a broader series on covert Russian influence that won a Pulitzer Prize for international reporting.\n",
      "And sometimes even the most observant Times readers do not remember that, during the campaign, we wrote extensively about Mrs. Clinton’s biography, her civil rights work, her economic policy, and her advocacy on behalf of victims of gun violence.\n",
      "Now, to be clear, I’m not suggesting that we embrace a kind of false equivalency — I’m skeptical of the old line that “if everyone’s mad, then we’re doing our jobs.” But I am saying that our most important function is to report aggressively and to arm readers with the information they need to make their own decisions, rather than to promote any single outcome.\n",
      "It surprises some readers to know that the same reporter who broke the story about Mrs. Clinton’s private email server when she was secretary of state also broke the big stories last year about why Mr. Trump fired James Comey and the president’s efforts to shut down the federal investigation into Michael Flynn.\n",
      "Our approach may strike some as old-fashioned. But we believe it’s the most important role the news media can play in supporting a healthy democratic society.\n",
      "I’m always sorry when readers feel let down by our coverage. We work hard every day to earn your trust. We have devoted tremendous reporting resources since the election to examining every part of this political moment — the anger, the divisions, the rise of both anti- and pro-Trump activism.\n",
      "These are crucial stories for us and, we think, for the country. And I think if you began reading The Times again, you would find that coverage deep and insightful and informative. I very much hope you’ll return as a subscriber in the future.\n",
      "_____\n",
      "As a longtime subscriber, my faith in The Times was deeply shaken when the Hillary numbers we saw every day leading up to the election turned out to be so incredibly off the mark. It was 82/18, 84/16; Hillary was going to dominate. After Trump won I kept asking myself how my dear New York Times could have gotten it so wrong.\n",

      "What kinds of things will you do in the future to improve the accuracy of these types of polls?— Andy F., in Vietnam\n",
      "Because I’m not a polling expert, I asked Amanda Cox, who as the editor of The Upshot oversees much of this coverage, for her insight. She responded to your question about how something with 16 percent odds — in this case Mr. Trump winning the presidency — could have happened:\n",
      "Sixteen percent is like rolling a die and looking for a three to come up. If it happened, you might feel surprised — chances were against you — but you wouldn’t feel like the entire system was broken.\n",
      "But I also understand that lots of our readers do feel let down, and that saying it was probability, not prophecy, doesn’t help them …\n",
      "I still believe that “What do all these polls mean?” is basically a noble question, and that models are a rigorous and disciplined way to think about it.\n",
      "I personally think polls can provide useful information and insight. But regardless of where you come down on that issue, I can assure you that our editors are actively examining the lessons from the last election and are committed to using those insights to update our approach.\n",
      "We’re going to do more to ensure we provide sufficient context to make sense of the polls and their limitations. (If you’re interested in reading a bit more, David Leonhardt, a Times opinion columnist and the founding editor of The Upshot, recently wrote a column on this subject.)\n",

      "How can The Times keep climate-change issues at the forefront of the news? Why is climate change not discussed when you have the opportunity to interview President Trump?— Ryan Young, in San Francisco\n",
      "Climate change is one of the most important stories of our time, and The Times is invested in covering it deeply and fully.\n",
      "Last year, we created a new desk dedicated to showing how global climate shifts are driving economic, social and political changes and affecting the lives of people everywhere.\n",
      "Our approach is to tell those stories in as many ways as we can. We’ve often turned to visuals because showing can be more powerful than telling, particularly when the science can be dense and complicated, and the scale of these challenges can make them feel abstract.\n",
      "Our interactive graphics have revealed how quickly ice is melting in Antarctica, how extreme heat is spreading around the globe and how Alaska’s permafrost is thawing. We’ve used drone video to capture vivid portraits of places like Jakarta, Indonesia, where we showed how the city is sinking so rapidly that it may soon be underwater. In a year marked by a surge of extreme weather like heat waves, hurricanes and wildfires, we used explanatory video to help explain the underlying science.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "At the same time, our reporters have been aggressively covering the Trump administration’s actions on climate, like the push to roll back environmental regulations and how that benefits the oil and gas industry. Eric Lipton and Lisa Friedman have been doing remarkable work investigating the changes at the Environmental Protection Agency. Throughout all this, we have asked tough questions about these topics in interviews with the president and members of his administration — we’ve even taken the administration to court to force them to release information — and we will continue to do so.\n",

      "I love The Times’s news coverage, but I’m chagrined to find so many typographical errors in your articles. Please, can you bring your copy editors back? The errors distract from the stories.— Lisl Christie, in Santa Rosa, Calif.\n",
      "First, allow me to correct the record a bit. While we no longer have a separate copy-desk operation, the majority of our copy editors are still on staff, and still editing copy. But we did significantly change our editing system for the first time in many decades, for two reasons.\n",
      "First, we felt our editing systems and processes needed to be updated to meet the evolving needs of an increasingly digitally focused newsroom. Second, in recent years, largely because of uneven staff turnover, the number of editors had grown significantly larger in relation to the number of reporters, and it was necessary to rebalance a bit so we could put more reporters in the field.\n",
      "Many people, both inside and outside the Times building, were upset with the changes. I understand that. It’s been hard to shift how we work, and it was painful to say goodbye to some longtime colleagues. But as the world changes, The Times must change, too.\n",
      "As for any mistakes you’re seeing: Every week we publish about the number of words you’ll find in the complete works of William Shakespeare. Despite considerable efforts, it’s inevitable that some typos, misspellings and grammatical errors will make their way into our report. We’re tracking the effects of our new editing system closely, and the changes have indeed resulted in a modest uptick of such errors. As we continue to refine our systems, we remain confident that the errors will decrease over the coming months.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Finally, it’s worth saying that even with the editing changes, The Times has the largest and best trained staff of editors of any newspaper. Every piece of journalism we publish is read carefully by at least two experienced editors. I believe that if you compare our pages with those of other news organizations, you’ll find that ours display the highest standards of quality.\n",

I subscribe online (because I can’t get daily delivery), but I also purchase the Friday paper at a newsstand and get the Sunday paper through home delivery. Although you can’t foretell the future, what would cause The Times to abandon its printed form, especially outside the New York City area?— Andy Candor, in Fort Wayne, Ind.\n",
      "I get asked this question all the time, which is a reminder of how much people still love the experience of reading the printed newspaper. And it’s easy to understand why — curling up on the couch with the Sunday paper is one of the highlights of my week.\n",
      "The good news is that with a million deeply loyal subscribers, we expect the print paper to be around for a long, long time. Though many newspapers have cut back on print, we’ve gone the opposite direction — adding new special sections like Puzzle Mania!, The New York Times for Kids and The Lost Children of Tuam.\n",

      "Basically, it’s as simple as this: Great journalism is really expensive, and right now we rely on subscriptions to pay for this important work.\n",
      "We employ more than 1,450 journalists who scour the world for the most important stories and then bring them to life in the most creative and compelling ways. We put reporters on the ground in more than 150 countries every year.\n",
      "We maintain a full-time presence in dangerous places like Iraq and Afghanistan and support journalists doing hard and important work covering war, natural disasters and genocide.\n",
      "We employ experts in countless fields — our staff includes people with backgrounds in law, medicine, business, science, economics, statistics, the military and more — whose skills, training and experiences allow them to bring you information and insights others can’t.\n",
      "We’re also one of the few news organizations that still give reporters months to dig into a single story — I’m not sure there is anywhere else where a reporter would be given 18 months to chronicle the life of one homeless girl.\n",
      "As print advertising has declined, we’ve had to find new ways to support all of this hard and expensive work. Fortunately, our readers have largely been willing to fill that gap. Ultimately, for less than the cost of a subway ride each day, a print subscription brings you stories and insights from every corner of the globe — so I hope that when you do pay for The Times, you’ll never question the value you’re getting.\n",

And as we’ve increased our hiring over the last year, more than 60 percent of new hires have been women and more than 35 percent are people of color. At the same time we’ve expanded our coverage of gender and race.\n",
      "But I also believe we can do better. To point to one obvious example, our lineup of columnists still needs to be more diverse.

I think it will make our journalism better and our business stronger.\n",

At a moment when so many journalists and commentators are writing about the same few stories, he keeps going to parts of the world whose stories aren’t being told to shine a spotlight on injustice and suffering. His commitment to writing about less-covered issues like the plight of the Rohingya (an issue he’s been warning the world about for years) is something I admire deeply.\n",

Even as other newsrooms were drastically cut in recent years, he made additional investments that ensured The Times’s newsroom was stronger than ever.\n",

To give one specific example, we’ve made clear that our reporting did not fully capture the anger, frustration and alienation around the country that helped fuel Trump’s rise. Over the last year, we assigned some of our best people to cover “red state” America, and they’ve done valuable and illuminating work.\n",

      "But there are also some ways that being young for a role like this has advantages. The most important is that I’m keenly aware that I need to continue to learn and grow, which I believe is essential in a world that is changing this fast. (In fact, I think it’s essential for anyone, of any age or experience, who works in the media business.)\n",
      "Another is that it wasn’t too long ago when I was out in the field as a reporter. Being deeply connected to the reality on the ground and having relationships with people at all levels of the company give me an extra layer of insight and empathy that can be really useful.\n",

      "Florida has agreed to pay $1.1 million in legal fees to lawyers who sued the state over a 2011 law that barred doctors from talking to patients about gun ownership, according to a gun control organization involved in the case.\n",
      "The organization, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said Gov. Rick Scott of Florida had approved the reimbursement to lawyers who represented doctors and medical organizations in the case, which came to be known as “Docs v. Glocks.” In February, a federal appeals court overturned the law, siding with medical providers over the state’s powerful gun lobby.\n",
      "“Florida taxpayers just paid $1.1 million because of the gun industry’s unconstitutional, antitruth agenda designed to increase gun sales at any cost — including children’s lives,” Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Center, said in a statement on Sunday. “Physicians have a critical role to play in preventing these deaths by talking to patients about the true dangers of guns in the home.”\n",

      "Advertisement\n",
      "The governor, along with the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature, pushed the restrictions through in 2011, becoming the first state to try to restrict the First Amendment rights of doctors to discuss guns and gun safety with their patients.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Lawmakers pursued the legislation after hearing from some patients who complained that their doctors had asked unwelcome questions about guns. The National Rifle Association, which supported the law, said pediatricians were interrogating parents about firearms to try to ban guns.\n",
      "Under the law, doctors could lose their licenses and face fines up to $10,000 per offense if they inquired about gun ownership and firearm habits. A group of doctors sued the state in 2011, saying that medical providers must be allowed to discuss guns with patients in the same way they discuss other safety risks and dangers, particularly for children.\n",
      "In February, a full panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit decided in a 10-to-1 ruling that the state could not punish doctors for discussing gun safety with patients.\n",

      "Jack Keil, the advertising executive who created and gave voice to McGruff, the cartoon hound who exhorts Americans to “take a bite out of crime,” died on Aug. 25 at his home in Westminster West, Vt. He was 94.\n",
      "His death was confirmed by his daughter, Betsy Kluck-Keil, who said he had recently learned that he had pancreatic cancer.\n",
      "Mr. Keil worked on ad campaigns for Toyota, Cheerios and Life Savers during his years with the New York advertising agency Dancer Fitzgerald Sample (which was acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi in the 1980s). But his most enduring work began in 1979, when he spearheaded a pro bono campaign intended to educate Americans on how they could help reduce crime.\n",
      "Mr. Keil (it rhymes with “smile”) decided to try a catchy slogan delivered by an animal mascot, similar to Smokey Bear, who reminds people to prevent forest fires. He told Smithsonian magazine in 1988 that he had considered an elephant, a deer and a cougar before the catchphrase and the dog character coalesced in his mind during a trip back to New York from the West Coast.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“You can’t crush crime or defeat it altogether, but you can snap at it, nibble at it — take a bite out of crime!” he said. “And the animal that takes a bite is a dog.”\n",
      "Mr. Keil took the idea to his team at Dancer and soon McGruff the Crime Dog, a lanky hound dressed in a trench coat with weary eyes and stubble, was born. Mr. Keil provided the voice, the raspy sound of a detective who had just finished a long, sleepless stakeout.\n",
      "“He wasn’t vicious, not tremendously smart, maybe, but he was no wimp either,” Mr. Keil said. “He was a father figure, or possibly an uncle figure.”\n",
      "The character made its debut in 1980, and the name McGruff was chosen in a national contest soon after.\n",
      "At first McGruff advocated for small crime-fighting measures, like forming neighborhood watch groups, locking doors and leaving lights on to dissuade burglars. He later addressed drug abuse, gun violence, kidnapping and other crimes in public service campaigns in print, on television and on the internet. One commercial included a young Drew Barrymore.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Mr. Keil voiced most of those spots, including a brief segment with the talk show host Dick Cavett.\n",
      "McGruff still represents the National Crime Prevention Council, as the nonprofit organization that commissioned him is now known, and he remains a familiar and trusted figure, especially with children. Three studies conducted for the council by market research firms indicated that 8 out of 10 children and 9 out of 10 adults recognized him.\n",
      "Communities nationwide have had more real-world contact with McGruff than with most other mascots. People costumed as the character have made personal appearances to help thousands of police departments connect with the people they protect.\n",
      "A real-life McGruff met President Ronald Reagan at the White House in 1984 and appeared on the sitcom “Webster” in 1986. (Mr. Keil did not serve as the voice for either.)\n",
      "He continued to voice McGruff until recently.\n",
      "John Mullan Keil, who went by Jack, was born in Rochester on Dec. 30, 1922. His father, Alvin, owned a charcoal company, and his mother, the former Elizabeth Mullan, was a homemaker.\n",
      "He interrupted his studies at the University of Rochester to serve as a bombardier during World War II. He returned to graduate in 1944 with a degree in economics.\n",
      "After an unsuccessful attempt to forge an acting career in New York — he was passionate about music and theater — he turned to copywriting, worked for a number of advertising firms before starting at Dancer.\n",
      "Mr. Keil wrote two books on creativity in a corporate setting, “The Creative Mystique: How to Manage It, Nurture It and Make It Pay” (1985) and “How to Zig in a Zagging World: Unleashing Your Hidden Creativity” (1988).\n",
      "In 1950 he married Barbara Miller, who died in 2014. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a son, Nick; a brother, Richard; five grandchildren; and a great-grandson.\n",

It is a position that Ralph Northam, the Democratic candidate, spoke out for emotionally after the shooting, and which Ed Gillespie, the Republican, opposes.\n",
      "“This one struck home to me,” Mr. Stenger said. “We can’t have this sort of thing in our country. It’s going to undermine our ability to be free people. You can’t go to a concert in fear of some guy opening fire.”\n",

      "The outburst of violence in Las Vegas, in which the gunman killed 58 people and wounded almost 500, is roiling a tight race already in the spotlight as the nation’s major referendum this year on President Trump. Meanwhile, Virginia is still plunged in soul searching over monuments to the Civil War after white supremacists marched in Charlottesville this summer bristling with firearms.\n",
      "The state’s demographic upheaval has opened the door for Democrats to sweep seven of the last eight elections for president, governor and United States senator.\n",
      "But gun rights remain a potent rallying cry in many places. Democrats who lead with the issue are at risk of poking a hornet’s nest, as happened two years ago when Republicans retained control over the Legislature in races animated by gun issues.\n",
      "Virginia “has totally evolved” on guns, said Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, who was elected four years ago while boasting of his “F” rating from the N.R.A. He is prevented by law from seeking a second consecutive term. “If you’re a Democrat running statewide you are very comfortable coming out and saying we need to have more sensible gun restrictions here,” he said. “It is a different conversation.”\n",
      "Mr. Northam, a doctor and Army veteran, attended a candlelight vigil Monday night for the Las Vegas victims where he described caring for wounded soldiers in Desert Storm.\n",

Eric Greitens of Missouri, who last year ran an ad consisting entirely of him firing an automatic machine-gun — a cousin to the modified weapons used by the Las Vegas gunman.\n",

      "But in the final stretch, their campaigns and outside groups are aiming at turning out core supporters with attack ads and other messages aimed at the gut. The Gillespie campaign has raised fears of the Latino gang MS-13 threatening public safety. A radio ad says the gang “pushes drugs and turns young girls into sex slaves” and it accuses Mr. Northam of supporting “sanctuary cities.’’\n",
      "A gun control group lead by Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who survived a shooting in 2011, and her husband, Mark Kelly, plans to call on Friday for Mr. Gillespie to release the questionnaire he filled out for the Virginia N.R.A.\n",
      "The group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, wants to see Mr. Gillespie’s responses to questions asking if he favors ending permits for concealed weapons and allowing concealed handguns in K-12 schools.\n",
      "A spokesman for Mr. Gillespie, David Abrams, declined to respond specifically to the questions and said in a statement, “Ed will be a strong defender of Virginians’ Second Amendment rights.’’\n",
      "Although Virginia has moved leftward since the Democrat Mark Warner sought N.R.A. support in 2001 to appeal to rural voters while winning the governorship, there are limits, strategists said. In 2015, trying to wrest control of the State Senate from Republicans, Mr. McAuliffe and outside gun-control groups showered money and attention on two key races. Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group backed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, spent more than $2 million.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The parties ended up splitting the two races. Republicans kept their narrow Senate majority. The next year Mr. McAuliffe made a deal on a law expanding concealed-carry rights.\n",
      "Daniel A. Gecker, a Democrat who lost one of the two races, in the suburbs of Richmond, said the single-issue effort by Mr. Bloomberg’s group — which he did not want — turned the race into a gun rights referendum that cost him voters.\n",
      "“It took certain Republicans who would have voted for me based on my record as a local elected official and put them in a position where they would not vote for me because they believed somehow I would compromise the Second Amendment,” said Mr. Gecker, now president of the Virginia Board of Education.\n",
      "Some analysts said voters’ positions on gun control were already so deeply baked into both parties’ supporters that neither candidate had much to gain from the issue.\n",
      "“Northam would not be wise to spend a lot of time talking about the N.R.A. the way McAuliffe did four years ago, as Ed Gillespie does not come across to swing voters as anything other than a relatively centrist Republican,” Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said in an email.\n",
      "In the State Senate district where gun rights played a role two years ago, an area that stretches from Richmond west to the suburbs, three workers for a tree company were having lunch at a bagel place this week. Stu Todd, 35, said he was a hunter but saw no reason for people to own semiautomatic weapons. “Get rid of them,’’ he said. “They don’t do anything but kill people. You’re not hunting with them.’’\n",

      "We have had our initial shock and outrage. We have had our sending of prayers, our thoughts-are-with-yous, moments of silence and mournful vigils.\n",
      "We have had our recognizing of heroes, honoring of emergency medical workers and praising of community spirit.\n",
      "We have had — and continue to have — our partisan thirst to understand the motive, but just as important, to see if we can hang the murders like an albatross around the neck of political opponents.\n",
      "And we have had the ridiculous debate about when the right time is to talk about the American gun fetish and how to help prevent future attacks.\n",
      "I call this part ridiculous because there is not another word for it. What does it mean to say “Don’t politicize the shooting”? Politics is why there has been no substantial federal movement on gun control in recent decades. Politics is why the National Rifle Association greases palms and raps knuckles. Politics is why we are here. Everything in America is political.\n",
      "Also, anytime an American uses a gun to kill another American, that is precisely the right time to talk about how to prevent that from happening again.\n",
      "Indeed, as The New York Times pointed out this week, in the 477 days from June 1, 2016, to Oct. 1, 2017, there were 521 mass shootings. Finding a long enough lull to discuss this issue is almost impossible. There will always soon be another shooting.\n",
      "Whether we talk about it now or later, there is little to no hope for federal action on gun control. The modern gun debate, as it has been argued for decades, is dead.\n",
      "When we learned, to our great horror, that Adam Lanza had slaughtered 20 6- and 7-year-olds in their school in Newtown, Conn., along with teachers, teachers’ aides, a school psychologist and the principal — and Congress did nothing — the modern gun debate moved irreversibly toward its death.\n",
      "When we learned, to our great horror, that Dylann Roof, after strolling into a South Carolina Bible study and being welcomed by strangers, waited for them to close their eyes for the benediction before unloading his Glock .45-caliber until nine of the worshipers were dead — and Congress did nothing — the modern gun debate moved further toward its death.\n",
      "When we learned, to our great horror, that Omar Mateen had walked into a crowded gay nightclub in Orlando and massacred 49 people (wounding 53 others) — and we did nothing — the modern gun debate finally died.\n",
      "These were all U.S.-born American citizens who acquired their weapons and ammunition in America and used their instruments of death to lay waste to other Americans.\n",
      "And yet somehow, the people with the power to do something about this have made the decision to do nothing. They have calculated that the blood running through our streets is an acceptable level of collateral damage to secure and maintain an increasingly unfettered right to bear arms.\n",
      "For better — or probably worse — politicians who maintain a do-nothing position on gun control assume a military silence in the wake of these tragedies. But the Republican Party’s propagandists become afflicted with logorrhea.\n",
      "The disgraced former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly posted on his website about the killing field on the Las Vegas Strip:\n",
      "“This is the price of freedom. Violent nuts are allowed to roam free until they do damage, no matter how threatening they are. The Second Amendment is clear that Americans have a right to arm themselves for protection. Even the loons.”\n",
      "The increasingly incoherent televangelist Pat Robertson went so far as to blame the Las Vegas shooting on a culture of disrespect, including “profound disrespect of our president” and “disrespect, now, for our national anthem.”\n",
      "So, let me get this straight: Because Americans refuse to respect a bigoted, white supremacist, misogynist, transphobic bully with fascist leanings and Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the anthem to quietly protest racial injustice and police violence, Paddock shot up a country music festival? Ummm, yeah, right.\n",
      "But in a way, the gun-control debate had been dying all along.\n",
      "It died a little bit when much of America simply accepted that we have at least as many guns as people. It died a little when Americans accepted that over 30,000 people a year die of gun injuries in this country. It died a little bit when every American didn’t see as an untenable perversion the fact that in the wake of mass shootings, gun sales and gun stocks rise instead of fall. It died a little when Americans began to accept as normal something that is absolutely not normal.\n",
      "America is an anomaly. We stand alone. When it comes to this particular kind and scale of gun violence, America is exceptional.\n",
      "And yet, the fact here is that the N.R.A., the gun lobby and their congressional co-conspirators have, unfortunately, won this round. They have proved that the fear of infringement is thicker than the blood of children.\n",
      "That is why we have to construct a postmodern gun debate, one that recognizes that America is sodden with weaponry, much of it military grade, and that those weapons already in circulation will have a long shelf life even if the sale of new ones is banned.\n",
      "We have to develop language for having a conversation that centers on the deconstruction of fear and the elevation of public health and safety, rather than solely on the right to purchase and possess particular kinds of weapons.\n",
      "Many people who buy guns are simply racked with an irrational fear, one of several concocted and promoted by the N.R.A.: fear of crime or fear of government. Either way, the logical conclusion of these fears is apocalyptic. Crime is simply not as pervasive as people think; weapons are harder to get and properly use in response to crime than people think, and the government is neither nearing tyranny and totalitarianism (although I sometimes think it would be if this administration had its druthers) nor plotting confiscations.\n",
      "It took us some time to get to this place, and it will take us some time to walk back from it, but we have to start somewhere, even somewhere small, to get over the fear, to wind people down from the anxiety they have been trained to nurse.\n",
      "Republicans made a blood pact with the N.R.A., and that has prevented us from making any progress. Individual Americans are going to have to awaken to the reality that our gun hoarding has become a hysteria and we are actually safer as a country with fewer weapons, rather than with more of them.\n",

      "Good morning on this crisp Tuesday.\n",
      "The horror of the shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday, which left at least 58 people dead and more than 515 injured, has reverberated here in New York.\n",
      "Flags were flown at half-staff at state government buildings, and the Empire State Building went dark last night, save for a rotating orange halo, in sympathy for the victims of the attack and to highlight gun violence awareness.\n",
      "This gruesome attack may have you searching for ways to help. When asked by NPR what people can do to help the victims, the mayor of Las Vegas, Carolyn Goodman, responded: “Blood first.”\n",
      "We spoke with Patty Corvaia, the Red Cross’s external communications manager for the New York-Pennsylvania region, about donating locally and why it’s so important after tragedies and disasters.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Can donating blood in New York help those injured in Las Vegas? \n",
      "Yes. While it’s the local blood on the shelves at the time of a tragedy that actually saves lives, Ms. Corvaia said, New York is a blood exporter. Last year, 151,338 donors in our region gave 273,406 units of red cell donations to the Red Cross, Ms. Corvaia added, the most in the nation compared to other Red Cross regions. With a strong blood supply, the New York region can export blood if the need arises. If you donate blood to the Red Cross, you can even track when and at what hospital it is used, Ms. Corvaia said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "How can I donate?\n",
      "There are three types of donations. There’s the standard blood donation, where a needle is put your arm and about a pint of blood is extracted. There’s also “power red.” “That’s when we hook you up to a machine and we extract two units of red cells, and then we give you back the plasma and the platelets,” Ms. Corvaia said. The final type is platelets donation, where platelets are kept and red cells are returned to your system.\n",
      "Is there a blood type that is needed more than others? \n",
      "Yes. The most useful is O-negative. No matter what type of blood you have, you can receive type O-negative blood. For plasma and platelets, the universal donor blood type is AB.\n",
      "Is everyone allowed to give blood?\n",
      "No. You must be in good health, at least 17 years old (or 16 with parental consent), and weigh at least 110 pounds. There are also a number of other restrictions set by the Food and Drug Administration. For example, men who have sex with men must abstain from sex with other men for more than a year before giving blood. Those who received a tattoo in some states, including New York, must also wait 12 months before donating.\n",
      "How often can I donate? \n",
      "You can donate every 56 days for standard blood donations. The “power red” donation can be done every 112 days. You can give platelets donations every seven days up to 24 times a year.\n",
      "Here’s what else is happening:\n",
      "What’s better than a fall day in New York?\n",
      "We’re looking at a chilly and dewy morning, with temperatures around 58, followed by a bright and crisp afternoon with a high of about 73.\n",
